    "Our project uses audio features and lyrics to find similarities within sets of songs. The inspiration behind the project is a tool to give the user insight into creating a song akin to the input song(s). For example, a musician looking to write a hit R&B song may be interested in common features and language found in current chart-topping R&B songs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For purposes of this project, we are going to analyze the top five current hit songs for each of the following music genres: country, R&B/hip-hop, and rock/alternative, as determined by the Billboard Top 100 charts. For the week of May 15, 2021, the top 5 songs by genre are:\n",

    " 1) The user inputs up to five songs to analyze. \n",
    "\n",
    " 2) The inputs are run through Spotify's API to identify songs that are most similar to the input songs.\n",
    "     - Spotify has a recommendation algorithm that can take up to five songs, artists, and/or genres as seeds.\n",
    "     - The algorithm returns up to 100 songs that it determines are most similar to the seeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "      \n",
    " 3) In order to obtain a large enough sample of songs, the top X songs returned from the previous query are each run through Spotify's recommendation algorithm.\n",
    " 4) In addition to the track and artist, we will download additional features for each song from Spotify, including acousticness, danceability, energy, instrumentalness, and speechiness.\n",
    " 5) Once we have songs and song features, each song will be run through the Genius API to obtain lyrics.\n",
    "     - The Genius API does not have a mechanism for returning the lyrics of a song.\n",
    "     - We are using the LyricsGenius package to interface with the Genius API. LyricsGenius uses the BeautifulSoup library to scrape song lyrics from a page's HTML.\n",
    " \n",
    " 6) The data from Spotify and from Genius will be joined together in a pandas dataframe by track and artist.\n",
