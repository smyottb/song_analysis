,,"['To Parma, Modena, And Bologna', '', 'I strolled away from Genoa on the 6th of November, bound for a good many places (England among them), but first for Piacenza; for which town I started in the coupé of a machine something like a travelling caravan, in company with the brave Courier, and a lady with a large dog, who howled dolefully, at intervals, all night.  It was very wet, and very cold; very dark, and very dismal; we travelled at the rate of barely four miles an hour, and stopped nowhere for refreshment.  At ten o’clock next morning, we changed coaches at Alessandria, where we were packed up in another coach (the body whereof would have been small for a fly), in company with a very old priest; a young Jesuit, his companion—who carried their breviaries and other books, and who, in the exertion of getting into the coach, had made a gash of pink leg between his black stocking and his black knee-shorts, that reminded one of Hamlet in Ophelia’s closet, only it was visible on both legs—a provincial Avvocáto; and a gentleman with a red nose that had an uncommon and singular sheen upon it, which I never observed in the human subject before.  In this way we travelled on, until four o’clock in the afternoon; the roads being still very heavy, and the coach very slow.  To mend the matter, the old priest was troubled with cramps in his legs, so that he had to give a terrible yell every ten minutes or so, and be hoisted out by the united efforts of the company; the coach always stopping for him, with great gravity.  This disorder, and the roads, formed the main subject of conversation.  Finding, in the afternoon, that the coupé had discharged two people, and had only one passenger inside—a monstrous ugly Tuscan, with a great purple moustache, of which no man could see the ends when he had his hat on—I took advantage of its better accommodation, and in company with this gentleman (who was very conversational and good-humoured) travelled on, until nearly eleven o’clock at night, when the driver reported that he couldn’t think of going any farther, and we accordingly made a halt at a place called Stradella.', '', 'The inn was a series of strange galleries surrounding a yard where our coach, and a waggon or two, and a lot of fowls, and firewood, were all heaped up together, higgledy-piggledy; so that you didn’t know, and couldn’t have taken your oath, which was a fowl and which was a cart.  We followed a sleepy man with a flaring torch, into a great, cold room, where there were two immensely broad beds, on what looked like two immensely broad deal dining-tables; another deal table of similar dimensions in the middle of the bare floor; four windows; and two chairs.  Somebody said it was my room; and I walked up and down it, for half an hour or so, staring at the Tuscan, the old priest, the young priest, and the Avvocáto (Red-Nose lived in the town, and had gone home), who sat upon their beds, and stared at me in return.', '', 'The rather dreary whimsicality of this stage of the proceedings, is interrupted by an announcement from the Brave (he had been cooking) that supper is ready; and to the priest’s chamber (the next room and the counterpart of mine) we all adjourn.  The first dish is a cabbage, boiled with a great quantity of rice in a tureen full of water, and flavoured with cheese.  It is so hot, and we are so cold, that it appears almost jolly.  The second dish is some little bits of pork, fried with pigs’ kidneys.  The third, two red fowls.  The fourth, two little red turkeys.  The fifth, a huge stew of garlic and truffles, and I don’t know what else; and this concludes the entertainment.', '', 'Before I can sit down in my own chamber, and think it of the dampest, the door opens, and the Brave comes moving in, in the middle of such a quantity of fuel that he looks like Birnam Wood taking a winter walk.  He kindles this heap in a twinkling, and produces a jorum of hot brandy and water; for that bottle of his keeps company with the seasons, and now holds nothing but the purest eau de vie.  When he has accomplished this feat, he retires for the night; and I hear him, for an hour afterwards, and indeed until I fall asleep, making jokes in some outhouse (apparently under the pillow), where he is smoking cigars with a party of confidential friends.  He never was in the house in his life before; but he knows everybody everywhere, before he has been anywhere five minutes; and is certain to have attracted to himself, in the meantime, the enthusiastic devotion of the whole establishment.', '', 'This is at twelve o’clock at night.  At four o’clock next morning, he is up again, fresher than a full-blown rose; making blazing fires without the least authority from the landlord; producing mugs of scalding coffee when nobody else can get anything but cold water; and going out into the dark streets, and roaring for fresh milk, on the chance of somebody with a cow getting up to supply it.  While the horses are ‘coming,’ I stumble out into the town too.  It seems to be all one little Piazza, with a cold damp wind blowing in and out of the arches, alternately, in a sort of pattern.  But it is profoundly dark, and raining heavily; and I shouldn’t know it to-morrow, if I were taken there to try.  Which Heaven forbid.', '', 'The horses arrive in about an hour.  In the interval, the driver swears; sometimes Christian oaths, sometimes Pagan oaths.  Sometimes, when it is a long, compound oath, he begins with Christianity and merges into Paganism.  Various messengers are despatched; not so much after the horses, as after each other; for the first messenger never comes back, and all the rest imitate him.  At length the horses appear, surrounded by all the messengers; some kicking them, and some dragging them, and all shouting abuse to them.  Then, the old priest, the young priest, the Avvocáto, the Tuscan, and all of us, take our places; and sleepy voices proceeding from the doors of extraordinary hutches in divers parts of the yard, cry out ‘Addio corrière mio!  Buon’ viággio, corrière!’  Salutations which the courier, with his face one monstrous grin, returns in like manner as we go jolting and wallowing away, through the mud.', '', 'At Piacenza, which was four or five hours’ journey from the inn at Stradella, we broke up our little company before the hotel door, with divers manifestations of friendly feeling on all sides.  The old priest was taken with the cramp again, before he had got half-way down the street; and the young priest laid the bundle of books on a door-step, while he dutifully rubbed the old gentleman’s legs.  The client of the Avvocáto was waiting for him at the yard-gate, and kissed him on each cheek, with such a resounding smack, that I am afraid he had either a very bad case, or a scantily-furnished purse.  The Tuscan, with a cigar in his mouth, went loitering off, carrying his hat in his hand that he might the better trail up the ends of his dishevelled moustache.  And the brave Courier, as he and I strolled away to look about us, began immediately to entertain me with the private histories and family affairs of the whole party.', '', 'A brown, decayed, old town, Piacenza is.  A deserted, solitary, grass-grown place, with ruined ramparts; half filled-up trenches, which afford a frowsy pasturage to the lean kine that wander about them; and streets of stern houses, moodily frowning at the other houses over the way.  The sleepiest and shabbiest of soldiery go wandering about, with the double curse of laziness and poverty, uncouthly wrinkling their misfitting regimentals; the dirtiest of children play with their impromptu toys (pigs and mud) in the feeblest of gutters; and the gauntest of dogs trot in and out of the dullest of archways, in perpetual search of something to eat, which they never seem to find.  A mysterious and solemn Palace, guarded by two colossal statues, twin Genii of the place, stands gravely in the midst of the idle town; and the king with the marble legs, who flourished in the time of the thousand and one Nights, might live contentedly inside of it, and never have the energy, in his upper half of flesh and blood, to want to come out.', '', 'What a strange, half-sorrowful and half-delicious doze it is, to ramble through these places gone to sleep and basking in the sun!  Each, in its turn, appears to be, of all the mouldy, dreary, God-forgotten towns in the wide world, the chief.  Sitting on this hillock where a bastion used to be, and where a noisy fortress was, in the time of the old Roman station here, I became aware that I have never known till now, what it is to be lazy.  A dormouse must surely be in very much the same condition before he retires under the wool in his cage; or a tortoise before he buries himself.', '', 'I feel that I am getting rusty.  That any attempt to think, would be accompanied with a creaking noise.  That there is nothing, anywhere, to be done, or needing to be done.  That there is no more human progress, motion, effort, or advancement, of any kind beyond this.  That the whole scheme stopped here centuries ago, and laid down to rest until the Day of Judgment.', '', 'Never while the brave Courier lives!  Behold him jingling out of Piacenza, and staggering this way, in the tallest posting-chaise ever seen, so that he looks out of the front window as if he were peeping over a garden wall; while the postilion, concentrated essence of all the shabbiness of Italy, pauses for a moment in his animated conversation, to touch his hat to a blunt-nosed little Virgin, hardly less shabby than himself, enshrined in a plaster Punch’s show outside the town.', '', 'In Genoa, and thereabouts, they train the vines on trellis-work, supported on square clumsy pillars, which, in themselves, are anything but picturesque.  But, here, they twine them around trees, and let them trail among the hedges; and the vineyards are full of trees, regularly planted for this purpose, each with its own vine twining and clustering about it.  Their leaves are now of the brightest gold and deepest red; and never was anything so enchantingly graceful and full of beauty.  Through miles of these delightful forms and colours, the road winds its way.  The wild festoons, the elegant wreaths, and crowns, and garlands of all shapes; the fairy nets flung over great trees, and making them prisoners in sport; the tumbled heaps and mounds of exquisite shapes upon the ground; how rich and beautiful they are!  And every now and then, a long, long line of trees, will be all bound and garlanded together: as if they had taken hold of one another, and were coming dancing down the field!', 'Parma has cheerful, stirring streets, for an Italian town; and consequently is not so characteristic as many places of less note.  Always excepting the retired Piazza, where the Cathedral, Baptistery, and Campanile—ancient buildings, of a sombre brown, embellished with innumerable grotesque monsters and dreamy-looking creatures carved in marble and red stone—are clustered in a noble and magnificent repose.  Their silent presence was only invaded, when I saw them, by the twittering of the many birds that were flying in and out of the crevices in the stones and little nooks in the architecture, where they had made their nests.  They were busy, rising from the cold shade of Temples made with hands, into the sunny air of Heaven.  Not so the worshippers within, who were listening to the same drowsy chaunt, or kneeling before the same kinds of images and tapers, or whispering, with their heads bowed down, in the selfsame dark confessionals, as I had left in Genoa and everywhere else.', '', 'The decayed and mutilated paintings with which this church is covered, have, to my thinking, a remarkably mournful and depressing influence.  It is miserable to see great works of art—something of the Souls of Painters—perishing and fading away, like human forms.  This cathedral is odorous with the rotting of Correggio’s frescoes in the Cupola.  Heaven knows how beautiful they may have been at one time.  Connoisseurs fall into raptures with them now; but such a labyrinth of arms and legs: such heaps of foreshortened limbs, entangled and involved and jumbled together: no operative surgeon, gone mad, could imagine in his wildest delirium.', '', 'There is a very interesting subterranean church here: the roof supported by marble pillars, behind each of which there seemed to be at least one beggar in ambush: to say nothing of the tombs and secluded altars.  From every one of these lurking-places, such crowds of phantom-looking men and women, leading other men and women with twisted limbs, or chattering jaws, or paralytic gestures, or idiotic heads, or some other sad infirmity, came hobbling out to beg, that if the ruined frescoes in the cathedral above, had been suddenly animated, and had retired to this lower church, they could hardly have made a greater confusion, or exhibited a more confounding display of arms and legs.', '', 'There is Petrarch’s Monument, too; and there is the Baptistery, with its beautiful arches and immense font; and there is a gallery containing some very remarkable pictures, whereof a few were being copied by hairy-faced artists, with little velvet caps more off their heads than on.  There is the Farnese Palace, too; and in it one of the dreariest spectacles of decay that ever was seen—a grand, old, gloomy theatre, mouldering away.', '', 'It is a large wooden structure, of the horse-shoe shape; the lower seats arranged upon the Roman plan, but above them, great heavy chambers; rather than boxes, where the Nobles sat, remote in their proud state.  Such desolation as has fallen on this theatre, enhanced in the spectator’s fancy by its gay intention and design, none but worms can be familiar with.  A hundred and ten years have passed, since any play was acted here.  The sky shines in through the gashes in the roof; the boxes are dropping down, wasting away, and only tenanted by rats; damp and mildew smear the faded colours, and make spectral maps upon the panels; lean rags are dangling down where there were gay festoons on the Proscenium; the stage has rotted so, that a narrow wooden gallery is thrown across it, or it would sink beneath the tread, and bury the visitor in the gloomy depth beneath.  The desolation and decay impress themselves on all the senses.  The air has a mouldering smell, and an earthy taste; any stray outer sounds that straggle in with some lost sunbeam, are muffled and heavy; and the worm, the maggot, and the rot have changed the surface of the wood beneath the touch, as time will seam and roughen a smooth hand.  If ever Ghosts act plays, they act them on this ghostly stage.', '', 'It was most delicious weather, when we came into Modena, where the darkness of the sombre colonnades over the footways skirting the main street on either side, was made refreshing and agreeable by the bright sky, so wonderfully blue.  I passed from all the glory of the day, into a dim cathedral, where High Mass was performing, feeble tapers were burning, people were kneeling in all directions before all manner of shrines, and officiating priests were crooning the usual chant, in the usual, low, dull, drawling, melancholy tone.', '', 'Thinking how strange it was, to find, in every stagnant town, this same Heart beating with the same monotonous pulsation, the centre of the same torpid, listless system, I came out by another door, and was suddenly scared to death by a blast from the shrillest trumpet that ever was blown.  Immediately, came tearing round the corner, an equestrian company from Paris: marshalling themselves under the walls of the church, and flouting, with their horses’ heels, the griffins, lions, tigers, and other monsters in stone and marble, decorating its exterior.  First, there came a stately nobleman with a great deal of hair, and no hat, bearing an enormous banner, on which was inscribed, Mazeppa! to-night!  Then, a Mexican chief, with a great pear-shaped club on his shoulder, like Hercules.  Then, six or eight Roman chariots: each with a beautiful lady in extremely short petticoats, and unnaturally pink tights, erect within: shedding beaming looks upon the crowd, in which there was a latent expression of discomposure and anxiety, for which I couldn’t account, until, as the open back of each chariot presented itself, I saw the immense difficulty with which the pink legs maintained their perpendicular, over the uneven pavement of the town: which gave me quite a new idea of the ancient Romans and Britons.  The procession was brought to a close, by some dozen indomitable warriors of different nations, riding two and two, and haughtily surveying the tame population of Modena: among whom, however, they occasionally condescended to scatter largesse in the form of a few handbills.  After caracolling among the lions and tigers, and proclaiming that evening’s entertainments with blast of trumpet, it then filed off, by the other end of the square, and left a new and greatly increased dulness behind.', '', 'When the procession had so entirely passed away, that the shrill trumpet was mild in the distance, and the tail of the last horse was hopelessly round the corner, the people who had come out of the church to stare at it, went back again.  But one old lady, kneeling on the pavement within, near the door, had seen it all, and had been immensely interested, without getting up; and this old lady’s eye, at that juncture, I happened to catch: to our mutual confusion.  She cut our embarrassment very short, however, by crossing herself devoutly, and going down, at full length, on her face, before a figure in a fancy petticoat and a gilt crown; which was so like one of the procession-figures, that perhaps at this hour she may think the whole appearance a celestial vision.  Anyhow, I must certainly have forgiven her her interest in the Circus, though I had been her Father Confessor.', '', 'There was a little fiery-eyed old man with a crooked shoulder, in the cathedral, who took it very ill that I made no effort to see the bucket (kept in an old tower) which the people of Modena took away from the people of Bologna in the fourteenth century, and about which there was war made and a mock-heroic poem by Tassone, too.  Being quite content, however, to look at the outside of the tower, and feast, in imagination, on the bucket within; and preferring to loiter in the shade of the tall Campanile, and about the cathedral; I have no personal knowledge of this bucket, even at the present time.', '', 'Indeed, we were at Bologna, before the little old man (or the Guide-Book) would have considered that we had half done justice to the wonders of Modena.  But it is such a delight to me to leave new scenes behind, and still go on, encountering newer scenes—and, moreover, I have such a perverse disposition in respect of sights that are cut, and dried, and dictated—that I fear I sin against similar authorities in every place I visit.', '', 'Be this as it may, in the pleasant Cemetery at Bologna, I found myself walking next Sunday morning, among the stately marble tombs and colonnades, in company with a crowd of Peasants, and escorted by a little Cicerone of that town, who was excessively anxious for the honour of the place, and most solicitous to divert my attention from the bad monuments: whereas he was never tired of extolling the good ones.  Seeing this little man (a good-humoured little man he was, who seemed to have nothing in his face but shining teeth and eyes) looking wistfully at a certain plot of grass, I asked him who was buried there.  ‘The poor people, Signore,’ he said, with a shrug and a smile, and stopping to look back at me—for he always went on a little before, and took off his hat to introduce every new monument.  ‘Only the poor, Signore!  It’s very cheerful.  It’s very lively.  How green it is, how cool!  It’s like a meadow!  There are five,’—holding up all the fingers of his right hand to express the number, which an Italian peasant will always do, if it be within the compass of his ten fingers,—‘there are five of my little children buried there, Signore; just there; a little to the right.  Well!  Thanks to God!  It’s very cheerful.  How green it is, how cool it is!

This interview is sponsored by Scott Edward Walker of walkercorporatelaw.com, but I’ll tell you more about Scott later. For now, I want to welcome Tom. Tom, welcome.', '', 'Tom: Woo! Great to be here. Big fan. Thanks for having me.', '', 'Andrew: Thanks. You know and it means a lot to me too that you’re not just a guy who’s here doing the interview but you’re a fan who’s heard my past interviews.', '', 'Tom: Patio eleven. Big ups to patio eleven. Love him. Great guy. Big inspiration. Much love.', '', 'Andrew: Patrick McKenzie. He did the interview here when he was living in Japan. I think it was soon after he quit his job after reading about start- ups, building his company. And you were in the audience. So cool that you were in the audience watching.', '', 'Hey, I went with took less than six hours to build the site. And the reason why I kind of rushed through that intro was because it just felt so gimmicky. And I just realized after reading it that I couldn’t stand by my own intro. So let’s explain it a little bit. It took six hours partially because time in that you put into a previous, I call BetterMetroNorth. What was BetterMetroNorth, and is actually?', '', 'Tom: Right. So BetterMetroNorth is a website. It’s BetterMetroNorth.com. It’s still up and running today.', '', 'Andrew: Mm-hmm.', '', 'Tom: And it’s a website that makes it very easy to get train schedules on MetroNorth Railroad which is a train system that runs throughout New York and Connecticut. And the germ of the idea came. I was actually visiting some friends who were at Yale Law School at the time. And I was trying to decide whether to go to law school.', '', 'And while I was there, I was, like, I definitely don’t want to go to law school. And so I was sitting in on a class that was making the final decision that I didn’t want to go to law school. And in the class, I was, like, well, I’ve got to get a train to go home. And the website was really bad. And I was, like, all right, I can hack something together to do better.', '', 'And so in that class, I hacked it together. And then kind of refined it and eventually released it as a standalone site. It still exists today. It basically grabs the schedule from MetroNorth’s website, which is ugly and hard to use. It requires you their one page to get the schedule, another page to get fare information.', '', 'And it compiles schedules of fares together in a very nice little table. It shows it to the user and you can click reverse trip to see the trains on the way back. So BetterMetroNorth was this project I was building. I was kind of in a mode at the time building a lot of projects on the web. I had really just gotten into programming and I also wanted to quit my job. Like Patrick McKenzie. You like Patrick McKenzie a lot.', 'Andrew: He was a salary man too and he was looking to quit.', '', 'Tom: Yeah.', '', 'Andrew: Your model though wasn’t to find one thing. You wanted to build, what was it, 20 different products, you wanted to do? What was the strategy that would eventually lead you to the business that would help you get out of the working life?', '', 'Tom: Sure. So I didn’t know what I ultimately wanted to build. I also had collaborators. I was working very closely at the time with my close friend, and roommate Ilan who’s one of the other RapGenius co-founders. And then Macmod [SP]. The third RapGenius co-founder, I didn’t work on the pre- RapGenius projects with, but he was there from the very first day on RapGenius.', '', 'And we were kicking around ideas, and I remembered thinking to myself, okay, I built a couple of things online. You know at that point, I had built BetterMetroNorth. There was a website called BombSheets which was the easiest way to buy bedsheets online. We solved the problem I’m sure you’ve had of going into Bed, Bath and Beyond and having a nervous breakdown at the site of all the different options for sheets and not knowing, like, which is good. So it’s great sheets, no hassle.', '', 'Fliff [SP] was another thing we built. This was a kind of a proto venmo. We had tracking debts and paying off debts between roommates. The idea came to mind when Ilan and I were moving in together, and he had to pay for the movers and I had to pay the security deposit. And we were, like, how do we, like BetterMetroNorth.', '', 'And so I was, like, you know what, I built four things online. None of them really took off, but they’re all pretty cool. If I build 20 things online, by that point, something is bound to take off. So I’m not going to worry about it. I’m just going to build one thing after another, and then see what takes off.', '', 'And the thing after BetterMetroNorth, RapGenius, which was in some sense the worst idea of them all, or at least the most distant from the idea of a business, ended up taking off. Although it didn’t really seem that way at the time. It took a long time before it really seemed clear that it was going to work.', '', 'Andrew: How would you know that one of these tests would work? What was going to be your yardstick?', '', 'Tom: Well, that’s what is funny about it is that the actual test was wrong, which was that it’s not good to build 20 different things and see what takes off. Because the way things fail is not because the idea is bad. The way things fail is because you quit.', '', 'And so with BombSheets, you know, we built BombSheets. I programmed it and then Ilan, and actually we were collaborating with another current RapGeniuser, Todd. You know we put BombSheets out there and we didn’t get a lot of traction. Not a lot of people bought sheets. Although we did buy sheets. So that’s like, you know, if you can put up an website and have someone who’s uterus you’ve never been in contact with, not your mom, buy something from them. It’s very hard. So that’s cool but we didn’t get a lot of traction.', '', 'So what we did was, we quit. We quit after about four or five months. It doesn’t necessarily mean bomb sheets was a bad idea. It was a bad idea in that duration but if we had kept working on it; if we had kept pushing and iterating on it then it would have become something.', '', 'In a lot of ways, RapGenius succeeded only because we decided not to quit. We kept working on it because the first 14, 15, 16 months of RapGenius was looking like a total failure, so you know, not quitting is a big important thing in being successful.', 'Andrew: You know what? It does seem like bomb sheets is the one that–.', '', 'Tom: [??], long way to go, I’m sorry.', '', 'Andrew: I’m sorry?', '', 'Tom: I just want to say, I think that not quitting is important in being successful. But I don’t want to say that like, I’m successful now because, it’s Day 1 for RapGenius today. We got a way long way to go before I’m calling RapGenius a true success. But, getting a little taste of traction takes –.', '', 'Andrew: And I want to spend some time here really diving into what got it from the idea to where it is today. But I have to ask you about bomb sheets because it does seem like a regret of yours. I’m wondering, of all the different things that you tried, why do you feel like bomb sheets; where you spent months on it is the one that you could have even spent more time on?', '', 'Tom: Bomb sheets was just the most recent one. And it was the one that had — I could have spent more time with Better Metro North, too. But, when I put Metro North out there, people were like, what about the Long Island Railroad? That’s was like [??].', '', 'So I could have done more with that. Bomb sheets is one I could have definitely done more. Not bomb sheets in particular. It’s any idea that you will be able to put out there that doesn’t become a big thing. It’s either not a big thing because it’s just not a great direction and you should have pursued it [??]. Or, it is a great direction and you should pursue it.', '', 'It’s just going to take a lot of work and suffering and obscurity to make it a big thing. There’s no way to know ahead of time, I feel. Or at least I don’t know, and so that’s why I think a big thing is; you shouldn’t work on something for four months and then think, ah, God, I went to college! I deserve instant success.', '', 'So yeah, again, don’t quit. Or maybe quit until you find the right thing and then don’t quit. We could of easily quit RapGenius. There were times when we came very close to quitting RapGenius, in fact. I remember there was one lunch where Ilan and I were at lunch and I was basically telling him, yeah, the thing about RapGenius is from a technical standpoint, I think it’s done. I think I finished it, it is what it is. It’s fine.', '', 'Maybe we should go back and work on bomb sheets again. We had a lunch where we literally talked about that and seriously entertained it. That was many months into the project. So we could of quit RapGenius easily. So don’t quit, if it’s good.', '', 'Andrew: It occurs to me that you’re a guy who’s in RapGenius, who’s into entrepreneurship but before, you worked at D.E. Shaw[SP] Company. I could never understand how someone who is so free-spirited, so entrepreneurial, who’s so into maybe not music as much as your co-founders you said but dancing.', '', 'How do you work at a company like D.E. Shaw? I tried to do that when I left college and I couldn’t bring myself to do it. And I’m not nearly as relaxed and comfortable — I definitely wasn’t at the time as you are with yourself. How do you fit into an environment like D.E. Shaw?', '', 'Tom: Sure, that’s a good question. To this day, I’ve got a ton of love for D.E. Shaw. and D.E. Shaw taught me a ton of things. I think the answer is that–I think the one thing that made D.E. Shaw not only tolerable, but in some ways great, at least in the earlier days was people there, were not totally like-minded in temperament and interests. But most of the people there were like-minded in terms of obsession with doing a good job and quality and being driven.', 'So when I was there, this was before I knew how to program. I learned to program there. Why? Because I was doing various assistant administration tasks. There were people there who were really driven and really good at using programming tools to help. And they would teach me that stuff. Then I went on to be a Product Manager.', '', 'The standard of quality, when you’re designing a feature or giving feedback on a feature. The level of quality you needed, that was really drilled into me, it’s like a really, really good job. Just doing a really good job; taking pride in your work; really pushing yourself. Even if the actual literal work isn’t the most interesting thing. Having a sort of craft you take pride in.', '', 'Also it taught me a bunch of things. I learned how to program because of D.E. Shaw. I learned how to be a Product Manager because of D.E. Shaw. I learned a lot about how to run a company at D.E. Shaw. At D.E. Shaw, I remember, one rule at D.E. Shaw is when you’re running a thing, you never want to put someone’s individual email address on a web page.', '', 'And say, if you have problems with finance, email Andrew Werner. You want to say email finance. You want to say email this mailing list. So if that person leaves the company, you’ll still have it. That’s like mundane stuff, that’s one mundane example.', '', 'A lot of stuff like that. D.E. Shaw was a well-run place. I get to facilities very seriously, like, you show up on day one your computer would be there, your desk would be there. Everything was there. You shouldn’t need a pen. It was all like that at every company. And so it was somewhat of an inspiration.', '', 'Andrew: I read the book, “The Everything Store” about Jeff Bezos, and unlike Jeff Bezos’ wife I love that book. And it talks about how much he learned from D. E. Shaw about analysis, about thinking about companies and markets. Did you get any of that, too, there?', '', 'Tom: You know, not really. I was building tools that the traders and other sort of financial analyst type people use, so I got some exposure to it in terms of building tools in a certain way. But I would say that D. E. Shaw taught me that analyzing situations and dynamics but not so much about the public markets. I’m also a pretty big skeptic about that kind of stuff in general even though I was working at a hedge fund. I don’t think anyone really knows anything. So I don’t know. [??]', '', 'Andrew: So you were in the experimental phase and you came up with the idea for RapGenius. How?', '', 'Tom: So I was getting into rap music in high school. In college I was never really into rap, like from a lyrical perspective. In college I like to dance to a beat that I could dance to. When I was in college the defining songs of my college experience were rap, two of them being “Hey Ma” with CamRom Juelz Santana. When I heard that song, I thought truly okay, it’s the end of history. Shut down music culture because we’re done. This is the best song that can ever be.', '', 'And then it happened again, or maybe this was first, but “Ignition Remix” which is rap. Well, “Ignition Remix” came out and that was like, whoa, this is the end of history. So those two songs kind of defined anyways my college experience, but “Hey Ma” is a good example. The lyrics of that, I love now, but back then I kind of mumbled them. I didn’t know what they were. I just knew it was an amazing beat.', '', 'So I was getting into rap and getting into lyricism with my friends, particularly my co-founders, but also my other friends and other people on the site were explaining it to me and explaining it in a very specific way. There would be a line, like a CamRon line. They’d pause the track, and then they said, “Listen to that. Hear that line? What that means or what that’s referring to that’s actually a subliminal record to this thing. Let me explain this now. Let’s go back and play it again.”', '', 'So we were having these conversations. I was blown away. I was like, there’s so much going on here that I had no idea about. This is amazing. And this, of course, was a beautiful time in rap. This was 2009. This was Lil Wayne was just like murdering everyone, and CamRon was more current than he is now. It was a beautiful time for rap, and it was a beautiful time for me to get into it.', '', 'So we would be having these conversations, and then we had the idea to take these conversations and try to put them on the Internet. Like create a site where someone could experience what I was experiencing in real time without having to have access to the people who were my friends. And so the original version of the site was called RapGenius. You can actually look at the original version of the site.', '', 'Andrew: I love that you kept it up. It’s RapGenius-Genesis.Huroku.com.', '', 'Tom: Yes, that’s right. Yes. That’s the original version of the site. That took me from 12:30 to 6:30 on August 26th, I believe, 2009, to create this and went out and that was the first version. And it’s pretty much the same it is today. I’ll say like it’s not so different today.', '', 'Andrew: So were you thinking about size, market, revenue, any of that stuff when you built these businesses?', '', 'Tom: Well, for [??] I kind of was.', '', 'Andrew: Not for RapGenius, not for [??].', '', 'Tom: Most of them were inspired by sort of . . . At the time I read “The Four Hour Work Week”. This was inspirational now [??] Some aspects were cool. I really want to build not a big business with a VC. I don’t want to make a ton of money. With RapGenius I wasn’t thinking of that. We were thinking like, let’s do this cool art project. I felt it was cool because the technology of clicking a line and seeing what was going on on the line, what it meant, but also why it was cool.', '', 'And also then that combined with the writers that we had access to which was my friends and a group of people, like 10-15 people who were really good writers. This technology is simple but cool plus these writers, I’ll make this really cool art project. And that’s what I kind of saw, this art project. And that what it was for a really long time.', '', 'Andrew: You know, I was telling Tim Ferriss the other day that he might be the most quoted person or the most referred to person in Mixergy interviews. And I asked him if he could talk about that part of the process. What is it about his ideas that somehow just touched you and so many other entrepreneurs? We’ll see if we can do that in the future.', '', 'At the top of the interview I said it took you less than six hours and I later corrected and said that it’s basically less than six hours because of the work that you did previously. What were you able to use so that you can launch within six hours?', '', 'Tom: Right. So this is like, you know, you can’t connect the dots going forward, or whatever. On Better Metro North, there was this interface where you could type in, using natural language the date for the train you wanted to get. You could say, show me trains on a week from next Tuesday, or whatever, and that would work. I thought it was really cool. Even though, when people use the site it’s usually like the button for today, or the button for tomorrow.', '', 'That’s what they click, rather than clicking the third option and typing some complicated thing. But that was cool. So I did that and I created a little help thing that allows you to understand how this interface worked. You click a little help button and this little tool tip would appear showing you, here’s an example of what you can type, and so forth.', '', 'When I was thinking about RapGenius and how can I represent the idea on the screen getting context [??] online. I was like, you know, that tool-tip library I looked at which is called Q-tip. It’s still on the Internet, you can look it up right now. I was like, that tool-tip library was actually pretty functional. Maybe I could repurpose it for a task that it was not originally intended. Tool-tip is to [bribe] contextual by using interface or something. But I think it’s actually a pretty full-featured library. Maybe if I re-purpose that to actually show actually show these annotations.', '', 'So the original RapGenius thing, I copied and pasted the Better Metro North code. So it is literally the code. I just took that library and reconfigured it and added a little bit of subtlety to the way it was integrated. That became the central interface, excuse me, the central UI paradigm of RapGenius which persists today. It’s not perfect, by the way, but it’s good enough; which is you click the line and a little bubble appears next to it. So it’s gone through some iterations but we’re still using the Q-tip library today.', '', 'Andrew: The same one? Now I think you even show images within those tips.', '', ""Tom: Right. So the Q-tip can contain any type of–any html. So yeah, we have images in there. Obviously, getting all that to work and the editing interface and everything was complicated. But the actual bubble that shows you an annotation is still that same Q-tip library, same damn 'Lo sweater."", '', 'Andrew: You know, I loved the piece that First Round did on you. The case study about how you built up RapGenius and how you were willing to launch without getting it perfect. I’m trying to square that with what you told us earlier about getting the right level of quality at D.E. Shaw. I’d imagine that someone with you background and who worked for a company with such attention to detail would have a wrestling match internally with releasing something that wasn’t right.', '', 'Tom: Oh yeah, oh yeah. So the [floss] being the first round thing; the main thing about that speech, was worse is better. Which is based with this idea that the worst thing you could imagine? Is the best thing! So, a fun exercise in the speech is I say, everyone yell out the worst thing you can imagine, and that’s the best thing. And everyone yells.', '', 'But the idea is, purposefully, when you’re trying to put a product out there, a new thing; release the worst version you can think of and try to make it bad and get it out there. The assumption underlying this is that, that is subverting your normal impulse.', '', 'So yes, my normal impulse, which is somewhat innate and somewhat taught to me by D.E. Shaw and other places is, make it perfect. Because details matter in software. Details matter and [your face] is the normal impulse. So the idea that worse is better, subvert that impulse and release something that sucks. A bunch of people are going to tell you that it sucks, so you’re going to know they’re right. And it’s still the right thing to do.', '', 'So that’s the challenge. It is very much against my impulses and I still get caught in a better is better trap a lot of times. It’s like, ah, I got to perfect it before it get it out there. I still get caught in that and that’s like a piece of vernacular here at RapGenius. Like someone will propose something and someone else will say, well that’s a little bit better is better. Which is kind of like saying, look I get it. That’s better but it’s not detail oriented but it’s not the worse is better philosophy and it’s not any good. I can get into why I think the better for worse philosophy is good.', '', 'Andrew: I want to ask you a question about an issue that I’ve had with that same philosophy because I believe in that. But why? You were going to say that there’s a reason why that makes sense.', '', 'Tom: Yeah. There are a couple of different reasons. The big reason, or the first reason I always think of is that, bad ideas evolve into good ideas in ways that you wouldn’t anticipate. The best way to have a good idea is to have a bad idea and watch it evolve. When you’re think of some kind of finished product or finished idea–or when you’re putting yourself out there with a bad idea, you’re thinking this is the thing I’m putting out there.', '', 'But really, that’s Version One. You’ll put it out there and you’ll look at it and then you’ll have other ideas. You have to trust yourself that you’ll be able to have other ideas that will evolve that bad idea into something good.', '', 'So that’s one core idea. A related idea, the second core idea, is that bad ideas evolve into good ideas but they evolve into good ideas with the data you get from having it out there. You shouldn’t shoot for perfection because you don’t know what perfection is before you start. You have to build something. You have to see how people will react. And the sort of thought experiment I used to think about this is, like, you are the dumbest you’ll ever be right now. You’re only going to get smarter. You’re only going to get more data.', '', 'So make as few decisions as you can now while you’re dumb, and postpone them to when you’re smart. And here’s a really good example of this. In the original version of RapGenius, there was this concept of confidence which was an attribute on annotations. You could add an annotation and you could say, I have confidence level high. And what this was supposed to mean was that I’m confident in this annotation.', '', 'Or you got a confident low which means, like, I think it’s what this line is about, but I’m not sure. And that was something that I thought was going to be important, but it actually was totally irrelevant. It was totally useless and irrelevant.', '', 'There were a lot of things I had to change from the first version of RapGenius to get where we are today. And there’s a lot we have to change in the future. But adding that confidence attribute, at least so far, has not been the most important thing. And yet, when I was sitting in the dark on my own programming, I thought it was important. But once the design reached the light of day and people started using it, I realized other things were important.', '', 'Andrew: What was more important than confidence?', '', 'Tom: For one thing, what was more important was giving people the ability to easily add annotations. Like giving a way to sign up, a way for you to add an annotation to a page that I was also editing without us clobbering one another.', '', 'One really important thing was giving people points for adding annotations. That was a pretty important thing. And the final principle is that, if you set yourself a standard for perfection when you launch a product, you’ll never be able to get yourself to put yourself out there at all.', '', 'Because you’ll always be thinking, like, aw, this isn’t perfect. Like it needs to be better. If you hold yourself to such a high standard, you’ll be too intimidated by your anxiety of influence. By like all the great things that happened before you. And, like, how can I put this out there at all if it’s not perfect and every little release things.', '', 'It’s actually even more insidious because you will be able to release some things, but the things you’ll be able to release are small. Small features, small improvements. And that’s a big problem. And this is, again, like sort of at my core of, like, what I think is important and what I think is unimportant.', '', 'Which is that my attention to detail is such that, like, I really want to release features every day that are going to smooth over small UI issues on RapGenius that’s just going to make it easier. Like you can shift and enter to save an annotation as a shortcut key. Or make it easier to add an image here or there or whatever.', '', 'And these things are good, but ultimately you need to think big. You need to think about big features that you’re going to release that are going to change the game. So my test is can we as a company IPO without this feature. If the answer is yes, work on something bigger. And so if you hold yourself to a standard of perfection, you will release only things that you can make perfect which will be very small things.', '', 'Andrew: “Wait. So you’re saying, do only create things that could eventually lead you to IPO?”', '', 'Tom: Only work on things that you need to IPO.', '', 'Andrew: I see. And when you do, create them in a small enough way that’s it’s a bad first version.', '', 'Tom: Right. Just do a bad first version of a really big important thing, and then try to improve it once it’s out.', '', 'Andrew: Gotcha. What about this though, Tom. I found that when I do do that, often I neglect things and don’t improve them. Like if I didn’t have this philosophy, maybe it would have taken me longer to launch interviews and I would have tried to get the video perfect and everything right, but at least I would have been on my path to improving the quality of the video.', '', 'Today, I launched it. It feels like it’s good enough. People can hear you. They can hear me. And I’ve left it, and I’m not thinking about how do I improve it. And so the question I have here is, does this culture of just launch it and then move on, or launch it and be okay with it lead to stagnation?', '', 'Tom: I think that’s a really good question. I think there are two sides to this. One is that, what is good enough. So you re-release your video platform and it works to a certain degree and maybe it’s not the most elegant streamlined thing that you would like, but it works. And then now you’re working on other stuff.', '', 'And the question is, is what you’re working on more or less important than improving the video thing. And it seems like you’re voting with your feet and saying, well, this is good enough, and there’s other high priority stuff I should do. So the other answer is that good enough is often, like, better than you might think in the abstract. Especially from a prioritization perspective. Like you have limited time on earth, what do you actually want to do.', '', 'Andrew: So how do you get feedback so that you know what needs to get fixed?', '', 'Tom: The second part of that is that getting caught in a worst state is a legit risk, and that’s something that’s happened a bunch in my life.', '', 'Andrew: Give me an example of you launching something that was the worst possible and you got stuck in the worst state as a result of it?', '', 'Tom: Hmm. What’s a good example? Well, one example is the support on the site for other types of text, right, beyond songs. We released this thing where you could put anything up, poems, books, movie scripts, etc. For a while it was just the exact same technology, so you’d have the Great Gatsby, and the Great Gatsby chapter one would be an album, and that album would be called, “The Great Gatsby,” and all the chapters would be tracks on that album. It’s like “OK, that’s pretty bad.” We made a lot of improvements to that, and we changed it.', '', 'I mean, now for example it doesn’t say, “Great Gatsby chapter one lyrics” anywhere, which was a problem, but I don’t think we’ve gone far enough in terms of supporting other texts yet, and this is something we’re working on now. I wouldn’t say necessarily we got caught in Worse Is Better, but we didn’t give…', '', 'Andrew: How do you prioritize, Tom? With all these different things that you could do, you could improve the way that people annotate rap lyrics. You can expand beyond rap, and go to more depth. You can get more traffic. You can do books. You can do video, which is a vision of yours, to allow people to annotate, I mean, this conversation. How do you figure out what’s going to be most important?', '', 'Tom: That is the question, product strategy, what do we build? That is the question. Not like “How does it look” or “How does it pay, and what’s the interface?” What do we build is the question. I think that gets at like the core of what it means to run a business. I mean I think the key sort of [SP] metapoint we were thinking about is you need to be very picky, you need to have focus, and that’s something that like once you’re in the position that RapGenius is in today, focus is very hard, because there’s so many things that we could do. You mentioned annotating videos, annotating images.', '', 'There are a bunch of people on the site right now who are saying, “Image annotation is the future, obviously. You draw a little lasso tool around the Mona Lisa’s eyebrows or lack thereof or whatever, and you annotate, what’s the deal with Mona Lisa’s not having…or her smile,” or “Take a picture of me, and draw a thing around my Nike’s or whatever.” That’s one thing we could do. That could be big. There’s a bunch of other stuff, the video thing, etcetera, so you need to have focus, and you need to say, “Okay, we can’t do all this stuff. Let’s pick one thing, and push towards it.”', '', 'With RapGenius, I think the strategy is interesting, because we have this rap community, this rap portion of the site, of the experience that is really strong, and something that we have to push forward and make sure it stays strong, but also make sure we innovate. You sort of think, “Okay, now that we’re in a community of hundreds of active moderators and thousands of contributors, how do we keep that community strong? How do we help think about once the other communities grow up, what lessons does this original community teach us about how to manage big communities of annotators,” so that’s definitely a priority for us, making sure that RapGenius not only stays strong, but also puts us in a position to learn…', '', 'Andrew: Do you have a framework for figuring out what’s next? Do you go for video or images, do you have a way of doing that or is it just “Which of those two is most likely going to get us to the big IPO, and that’s the one we’re going to go for?”', '', 'Tom: Well, the broad framework is to think about improving, preserving, and learning from what we have in rap and music, and then take other things, probably one other thing, and concentrate on it really hardcore, whether it’s image annotation, video annotation, the annotation of literature, the annotation of news, prime resource documents. Then within that, the way we think about priorities is we want to optimize for the hardcore contributors, the hardcore community members.', '', 'Andrew: I see.', '', 'Tom: 80 percent, there’s the 80/20 rule in UGC sites. We actually did the math this recently. It’s actually literally exactly true for RapGenius, which was shocking.', '', 'Andrew: What was it? 20 percent are?', '', 'Tom: Twenty percent of the users, the most active dedicated engaged 20 percent of the users, create 80 percent of the content. We think about those 20 percent of those users exclusively. This means going to RapGenius as one of the other 80 percent of users who’s not the core, they get not the best experience. They go and they think, “This site is jenky in some ways, and maybe not the slickest thing. This annotation technology, when I click on the little thing and the thing appears, that looks pretty similar to the first version of the site, so what have you been working on?”', '', 'Then they also notice, “God, these annotations are pretty good.” What makes the annotations good is building stuff around, encouraging, and helping the community that writes them. That’s what we focus on, because the quality of the analysis, the quality of the annotations is the most important thing, not the presentation, and how slick they look when you read them.', '', 'Andrew: I’m on the site right now, the version that you created and put up on Heroku. It’s got one song.', '', 'Tom: I know…', '', 'Andrew: You’re starting that small?', '', 'Tom: Not even a full song. It’s three couplets.', '', 'Andrew: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, three couplets, and so that was your experiment and then you bought rapgenius.com?', '', 'Tom: Well we actually stayed [rapxjesus] for about. That tells you how dumb we were back then, because rapxjesus is a pretty bad name. Then one of the founding editors of the site, also my roommate at the time, Ariel Shower [SP] big ups to Ariel. He threaten to delete all annotations and stop working on the site unless we changed the name. He was like, this is totally ridiculous. So we changed it to RapGenius about four or five months later and that was a good, good move.', '', 'Andrew: Your first users were your friends. You were emailing them. How do you go beyond your friends, to get people in a community that basically will suck, unless people annotate? Unless the people put in the work?', '', 'Tom: The most important thing when you’re thinking about a community like this, is you want to set the tone yourself. Because when someone comes to the site, they’re going to look at it and they’re going to say; okay I can sense what’s going on with this site. Are the people who annotating here, the people who are contributing here, are they like me or are they not like me? In other words, do they think about music in the way that I think about it? Do they take this seriously? Are they really interested in going deep, or are they just trying to act like a superficial joke? And not, you know?', '', 'Andrew: Got it. Like if they’re not taking it seriously as I am, then I feel like a douche if I take it seriously and I’d better get away.', '', 'Tom: Right. And so that was the early stage for us and we didn’t know we were doing this. We just thought we were doing a good job because that’s what we want to do. But we were really setting the tone with a high standard of quality in both the content and the like [??].', '', 'Andrew: I understand why you would do it, Tom. This is your baby. It’s your passion. But your friends who didn’t get a share in the business, who weren’t as invested; why do they care enough to post annotations onto rap lyrics?', '', 'Tom: Well it was cool, you know. It was..', '', 'Andrew: What did you do to make it cool enough that they would do that as opposed to go on Reddit [SP] and comment; or watch a movie on Netflix or do any of the billion, jillion things that they could do online?', '', 'Tom: Well, it wasn’t so different from like in college where we all had blog-spot blogs. So putting stuff online and talking about it. One example is Ariel. Ariel used ID too [??] threatened to kill me if I didn’t change the name. He wrote this epic log post in 2008 where he basically did a huge analysis of current sort of transit [SP] rap and concluded that Eclipse was the best group ever. That was this huge blog post he did and RapGenius was just a better format for that. He was writing it anyway on his WordPress blog, so it was just a cool way of presenting.', '', 'There was also this group project where we could get together and kind of argue about stuff and then come together and produce stuff that was not only greater than the sum of our individual contribution, but look like it was written; we used to say, by the voice of God. You can’t tell who’s writing this but there’s a ton of great content. And [??].', '', 'Andrew: So you said that one of the things that you discovered later on was the importance of points. Did you do anything to give people points or status early on when it was just a handful of people creating the culture of the site? What did you do? You’re nodding.', '', 'Tom: We had a Leaderboard in the earliest days which was just the number of annotations you created.', '', 'Andrew: Got it.', '', 'Tom: Not a bad, not a bad proxy, not a bad proxy. Then it got way more sophisticated and complicated. That was also after we open it up. In the early days, you’d have to talk to me to get an account, you know, so,it was just our friends. Then we put these ‘disk us’ comments at the bottom. We just dropped in that little [??] thing. And then people started leaving comments. People started saying, no you’re wrong about this, this is the right thing.', '', 'Then I was like, oh, that’s cool. Then we’d sort of invite some of those people in; we’d have maybe 10 or 15 of our friends and then maybe 10 or 15 people I had never met but were interested. We did that for a while and then we decided to open it up entirely; let anyone sign-up and then start annotating. That was a true engineering effort, to really allow for that. Because someone can just go crazy and delete the whole site, so you have to [??]', '', 'That also corresponded with the creation of the original rap IQ system which was based on numbered annotations, but also there was a whole editorial. Where if you were a new user and you posted and annotation, I as a editor would have to accept it before it would be visible to other people. So you’re getting your annotation accepted gets you points. I also got a couple of points but fewer for being a moderator. Then it got very complicated. People started gaming it. It was a whole headache but still the same fundamental idea.', '', 'Andrew: The group of users who were coming in, after you and your friends, where did you find them? How did they find you?', '', 'Tom: It’s amiss. Google Search was a great user acquisition channel, so to speak. I still don’t know, really, how you build a website and get people to use it. Google Search is kind of like a cheat code in some ways for that. If you think about it, it’s pretty weird that someone can type what they want into Google and end up on your site without even knowing you exist. That’s pretty magical.', '', 'The thing about something like RapGenius is it’s not like Twitter where you need millions and millions of users to make a great thing. It’s more like Wikipedia; one amazing contributor can create a canonical version of a song that will last a decade. Millions and millions of people will see it. It’s also very hit and miss. For example, one of our greatest early contributors, one of the only members of the 200 Club, which is having 200,000 plus total IQ, is a gentleman, Sean Sutaro [SP], who found us in the early days because he read about us in New York Magazine.', '', 'My opinion on press is that it’s not really that useful, generally. But in this case, now he works here full time and he’s a crucial part of the voice of the site and the thinking of the future of the site. If we had never gotten that New York Magazine Approval Matrix thing he would have never found us. That ended up being a very pivotal connection early on.', '', 'Andrew: That New York Magazine Approval Matrix, you were hoping that you were going to get traffic from it. You got no traffic from it, right?', '', 'Tom: Right, nothing.', '', 'Andrew: Nothing. Except you met Sean as a result from it.', '', 'Tom: Yes.', '', 'Andrew: Got it. So, 2010 was the year that you were describing earlier where things were going nowhere. The “Trough of Sorrow,” I think they call it at Y Combinator.', '', 'Tom: Yeah, I think that’s right. We launched in September or October 2009 and then 2010 was not great. At the end we started to see some glimmers of hope, but 2010 was toiling in obscurity, definitely. It stopped when we released the thing that allowed anyone to sign up and contribute, and then ended up being a big change. But before that, it was pretty bad.', '', 'Andrew: I’m looking at the version of the site that was up in 2010. “RapGenius explains rap lyrics. Click a song to reveal its meaning.” There are 10 songs on the site, and you limit it to 10 songs on the homepage and you seem to have limited the number of songs to maybe 100. Was that intentional to keep it focused on a handful before you allow people to annotate any song?', '', 'Tom: At that point we had this idea of publishing a song, where we would not release the song publicly and show people it was on the site until it was done, until it was at a certain level of quality. This goes back to setting the tone thing where we didn’t know what we were doing. The site didn’t have a ton of stuff, but all the stuff it did have was really good, and that’s way better than having a ton of stuff that’s mediocre. Now we have a little bit of a different philosophy; we have enough “good” stuff.', '', 'People understand the way it works. When you stumble upon something that’s bad, and there’s a ton of bad stuff, you’re more likely to say, “This is some bad, in-progress thing. I’m going to help make this better,” rather than say “This reveals that the people involved in this site don’t care about quality,” which is what we had to worry about in the early days.', '', 'Andrew: Did you get permission to use the lyrics on the site back in 2010?', '', 'Tom: Great question. No, we just did it. We believed then, and I believe now, that its very use to add in all this commentary and criticism and so forth is transformative. Obviously there’s a legal risk that you take when you do something like this. My philosophy on it is: If you think you’re being a good actor, can you look yourself in the mirror and say “Are you jacking from someone or are you creating something new?” If you can look in the mirror and say, “No, I’m not trying to just take someone else’s thing, I’m really trying to create a new thing that uses some ingredients,” then I think you have to go for it.', '', 'Andrew: Even today it’s considered transformative, so you don’t need permission?', '', 'Tom: I think it’s transformative.', '', 'Andrew: Do you pay licensing fees?', '', 'Tom: Someday, maybe, the transformative thing will come to the fore. It would be cool go to the Supreme Court and win, but that’s not what I think is a good use of our time. Right now we do have licensing agreements with most of the music publishers, and hopefully all of them soon. The other thing is you want to work with the music publishers.', '', 'I think there’s a lot of stuff we could do together, obviously like the verified artist stuff on RapGenius. Promoting yourself as an artist and getting deep in the music industry is a big part of what we want to do. It’s also good to just play nice for that reason as well. They’re cool guys.', '', 'Andrew: That seems like the common way that many lyrics sites that are big today started, by just grabbing lyrics and putting them on their site. In fact, one entrepreneur told me that the companies, I forget which, record labels, I think it was actually used to send him stuff to give to fans, to promote the fact the new album was coming out.', '', 'And so they knew what he was doing and then later on made a deal with him. Why did you stick with it during 2010 when there wasn’t money coming in? When you were saying that this is a tough period, what made you stick it out?', '', 'Tom: Good question [??]. Two things, I think, one; is that in our minds it wasn’t a business, it was an art project. And it’s a business, you have to think is this a successful business. But if it’s an art project, all you have to think is, is this a successful art project. And the criteria of being a successful art project is way simpler. It’s like, do I think it’s cool? Do my friends think it’s cool? Is this something unique? Is this something some else is doing?', '', 'It’s a way to use your criteria. It’s just like making money or generating investment interest. So that was one that. But even that is tough because there is the opportunity cost of your time. I’m thinking, God, if this doesn’t go well I’m going to have to get another job. I don’t want another job but.', '', 'The other thing is it did get — people liked it. The guy [at] the New York magazine, I remember the day I mentioned earlier where Ilan and I were at lunch. I was like, RapGenius is done. [??] Work on it any more. We went back to the apartment and Andy Vilodkin [SP], the Hype [SP] Machine had just tweeted, this is a cool website. The design is kind of [janky] or something like that. I saw that and we were just like, whoa! That’s the coolest thing! We love Hype Machine! This is great!', '', 'And so enough stuff like that happened where we were not thinking necessarily this is going to be a business or this is going to be something we can use to raise money and eventually create a business. But, this is a cool thing, it should be in the world, and should be better improved. So, yeah, that’s kind of like what kept us going.', '', 'Andrew: I want to ask you something that could come off a little jerky but I think it’s important to ask you. But first, let me do a quick plug here, for Scott Edward Walker. He is the entrepreneur’s lawyer if you’re a startup. If you’re running a start-up, you need a lawyer who understands the issues you’re coming up against and won’t look down on you. I had a lawyer once, I got a lawsuit from a major bank. He says the lawsuit and he started to freak out. And then he freaked me out.', '', 'Then I realized, this guy just doesn’t get my world. He’s freaking my out. I had to relax and realize that these companyies seem to send out lawsuits like it’s nothing. [??]', '', 'When I started looking at the binder for the lawsuit, I realized they included every brochure they came up with, every documented that they ever printed. To show that they were so significant, that I could potentially damage what they were doing.', '', 'Anyway, a lawyer who doesn’t deal with entrepreneurs is going to freak out so much more that one who gets the entrepreneurship community of pushing limits, of seeing what’s okay. And, he’ll understand to be there to support you. He’ll understand that you need to prepare for things that most companies won’t go through; raising money, selling out, dealing with co- founders, etc.', '', 'If you need a lawyer like that and you don’t want one who’s going to make you pay through the nose, I recommend you talk to Scott Edward Walker of Walker Corporate Law. Send him and email now. Here’s his email address: scott@walkercorporatelaw.com. Tom, the question is, why did you need co- founders? You seem to be doing well. You’re a smart guy.', '', 'Tom: No, it’s a good question. I think if…it’s interesting, a couple of things. It’s kind of a silly question for me, looking back on everything that’s happened. It is impossible to do something like this alone. What I mean like this is, I actually think it’s even broader. I think, anything big, anything worthwhile you want to do.', '', 'If you’re in business, anything project that you want to do that’s big and worthwhile, you just can’t do it alone. There’s just too much and it’s too hard if it’s new. So that’s the broad thing which is something I’ve come to believe not just about business but about everything. So if I were to start writing a book or whatever, you can’t do that alone either.', '', 'Now in this particular case, the importance of co-founders; if you zoom in on two things. One, is just if you’re staring into the void and you’re doing it alone, you can’t stare into the void alone. When you’re truly, truly starting into.', '', 'Andrew: Give me an example. When did you stare into the void and Mahbod [SP]? Am I prounouncing has name right, Mah bod?', '', 'Tom: It’s tough MahBood. Mac Bud. He went by Matt in High School.', '', 'Andrew: No. I want to get the right name. Tell me if I’m pronouncing it right Mah bud.', '', 'Tom: Mah bud.', '', 'Andrew: Mah bud. And Ilan.', '', 'Tom: So in the beginning, staring into the void, okay, no content on the site. Right? What are you going to do? How are you going to get the content up? No one is going to the site. So how', '', 'Andrew: So which of them helped you stop staring into the void and fill the void?', '', 'Tom: So Mabood was in addition to being one of those prolific people in terms of raw contecration [??] early on, was he was just amazing at building communities. What this means in practice is talking to a bunch of people on the Internet and inspiring them to join our mission of love and knowledge. On one individual case, there was someone who just hit us up and was so mean. He was like, you guys are like the worst, this project is terrible and I hate you guys.', '', 'My reaction it was, forget this. Like archive, we don’t want to think about this, whatever. Mabood was like, yo, you are 100% right but think about this, too! And blah, blah, blah. That guy is now a close friend. Mabood is so good at turning people from.', '', 'Andrew: That guy is a close friend?', '', 'Tom: Yeah, yeah, yeah.', '', 'Andrew: Okay, wow. By the way, I believe, I don’t always have the pa– actually I think I do often have the patience for that. But I believe in taking those, what people would call trolls and hugging them, really embracing them. Because if they’re so passionate that they’re saying things like that; then, you want to hear what their passion is and hopefully have them work with you.', '', 'Tom: Truly, big ups on my haters. I think Mabood has taught me so much about that kind of stuff, it’s great. And not just the haters, just like taking someone who’s kinded [SP] into the site and saying, let me inspire you in a ton of different ways. And also Mabood is a brilliant writer and wordsmith. If you go to his account, rapgenius.com/mabood you will see just a ton of amazing writing.', '', 'And Ilan, Ilan was my first, real, true business collaborator. We started way before RapGenius when we first moved in together. Mabood got involved with the RapGenius project at the very beginning but Ilan and I had been collaborating before that. Ilan and I just have a pretty unique, like, back- and-forth in terms of how we sort of run things or make things happen.', '', 'In one sense, in a very literal sense, I did do the programming and Ilan raises the money. But it’s not really like that, everything in terms of really running the thing, we’re bouncing it off. So I have a somewhat harsher personality in terms of how I want to deal with things; he has somewhat more of a shale[SP] personality. Us fighting that out produces great results.', '', 'Ilan is like — I was actually thinking the other day, I was with my friend Ario [SP] who is Israli too. And we were talking about Ilan. We were just thinking, God, Ilan is so likeable. We were challenging ourselves. We were like, name one person who doesn’t like Ilan; or that Ilan doesn’t like. We were like, I can’t name it. He is like just such — and the reason for that is because when you are talking to Ilan he is just zoned-in on you. He’s genuine. It’s not a trick, he is genuinely and deeply interested in who you are and what you have to say.', '', 'And that makes Ilan just crucially brilliant and valuable in a bunch of different situations, whether it’s a management situation, like the psychology of managing people who work for you. Like listening to feelings, hearing them out, understanding where they’re coming from. Or whether it’s raising money, and talking to an investor and really, really, connecting on a real level and understanding where that person is coming from.', '', 'Andrew: Let me ask you one other jerky question as a follow-up to the first one.', '', 'Tom: Sure.', '', 'Andrew: You still own more shares in the company, a bigger share of the company than they do. Right?', '', 'Tom: I don’t know where you got that idea.', '', 'Andrew: So is it equally divided?', '', 'Tom: The key thing to think about is all of us are onboard. So the real question about like who runs the actual, actual, actual thing; there’s a question of who is operationally responsible on a day-to-day basis on making this or that final call. But then there’s the question of the deep direction of the company, like, who is in that position to make the final call.', '', 'That is what the Board is for, so all of us are involved in that. And participating in terms of the real big direction of the company. On a day- to-day basis, we have different responsibilities, etc. The thing about setting up a company is that…the way things come together. Like the good thing we did at the beginning of RapGenius was we didn’t sit down on day one and think, okay, this is a company, we’re going to appoint officers to the company, we are going to split up equity in the company.', '', 'And you have to do that eventually. But you don’t want to do that when you are sort of splitting up percentages of zero. This is something I’m glad we delayed, in RapGenius. Earlier in my life, I was a sort of wantrepreneur who shows up to discuss an idea with someone who’s new to the idea, and I want to bring an NDA. Like, that literally happened to me. The main thing… the first or flip, the first idea was Alan and me, and we were going to talk to my work friend — you know, friend — Payton, and we were going to go to him and say, “Payton, what do you think of this idea? You want to work with us on this? Sign this NDA.”', '', 'And Payton was like, “What are you t-… get this… are you an idiot?” Like, we’re not going to do an NDA, we’re not going to set up a company, we’re not going to do anything. Let’s build the thing, and then see what happens. And, you know, now…', '', 'Andrew: So this decision didn’t happen until you raised money, it sounds like.', '', 'Tom: Until we got into Y Combinator.', '', 'Andrew: Y Combinator. That was a huge deal for you guys. Why do you think Y Combinator funded you?', '', 'Tom: That’s a good question. We did… first of all, we got rejected from Y Combinator the first time. We applied twice in a row, and then we got rejected the first time. So you can get rejected, and then the next time, you can apply and get in, and be one of the hottest start-ups at Y Combinator. So the world’s a crazy place.', '', 'Why did Y Combinator fund us? I think there were two reasons. One, objectively speaking, we were an attractive thing. We had a graph that was looking really nice. It was going up. It had passed a million unique visitors, which is a hard thing to do as a website that you just created. The graph was looking good. And so we were legit, like, good prospect.', '', 'Also, there’s a guy called Justin Cann, who denies it to this day, but I really think he hooked us up. Because we… he wrote this blog post where he was like, you know, the connection between entrepreneurship and rap music, and… you know, he wrote this blog post, and then he linked to us for the quoted various rap songs, and linked to RapGenius.', '', 'And we saw this. We were like, “Wow, this is sick! Like, Justin Cann, he’s a huge name!”', '', 'And so [??], of course, being down with talking to anyone in the world, hit him up on Facebook. We were chatting with him for a while. And Justin Cann was like… we were like, “Well, we were a finalist in Tech Star. Should we take that if we get in?”', '', 'And Justin Cann was like, “Yeah, probably, but, like, you want to do Y Combinator if you can.” And we were kind of like, “Well, we got rejected. Should we apply again?” He’s like, “Yeah. You’ve got a great website. It’s a growing website. You should apply.”', '', 'And so that encouraged us to apply, which we might not have even done. And that year, also, a little after that, before we applied, I hitched a ride with my friend Rich, who was going to South by Southwest for his company, and I stayed on his couch. First time I’ve ever used AirBNB.', '', 'And then I stalked Justin Cann after some talk, and I stalked him to the Starbucks where he was meeting with someone, and then when he got up and left, I bumped into him. I was like, “Oh, Justin Cann! What’s up?” And then we talked for a while that day. And I followed him around a little bit, and we talked.', '', 'I think… I don’t know if he put in a good word for us or something, but that was a good connection to the Y Combinator family, and sort of talking to him, getting his perspective really helped. And also, just encouraging us to apply. We might not have even applied.', '', 'Andrew: Yeah. I’m sure twice… after being rejected twice, I could understand why you wouldn’t.', '', 'Tom: Once, but it was… you know, when we were rejected, it was like, “Well, obviously we were rejected. Some crazy rap lyric adaptation website.” And then that’s the reality you form in your head. “Of course we’re not going to get accepted. It’s a totally ridiculous idea.”', '', 'Andrew: Why didn’t you accept that? Was it because Tech Star started to see some promise here, and so you thought, “All right, maybe”? Or was it just that the numbers were starting to go up?', '', 'Tom: It’s crazy. I mean, we got into Y Combinator, and we just were so, so intimidated by everyone who was there. And it was just this trippy thing.', '', 'Because before Y Combinator, no one cared. Like, no one cared. And I was kind of down with that. I was kind of like, “Okay, no one cares. Whatever. I’m used to that.” And then after Y Combinator, we had demo day and after, everyone cared. We were one of the hottest start-ups in that Y Combinator batch, and because of that, had a solid claim on being one of the hottest start-ups in the entire world at that time in history. Everyone cared, and everyone was into it.', '', 'And it was… three months had past, and to my eyes, nothing had changed. It was, like, the same website. We had grown a lot in Y Combinator, but the graph looked good before. You could have probably predicted some of that growth by looking at the graph. And the site was basically the same. The site had improved a little bit. It was only three months.', '', 'And we went from no one caring to everyone caring, in such a short amount of time. And that kind of convinced me, like, whoa, the world’s a weird place. I don’t know what’s going on, you know? You’ve got to believe. You’ve just got to believe in yourself.', '', 'Andrew: [???]', '', 'Tom: It’s true.', '', 'Andrew: And so the business didn’t change much through the three months. You grew as people. But it wasn’t externally visible yet.', '', 'Tom: We grew a lot in traffic, is really the truth. And Y Combinator, that was one of the fastest times of growth ever. “Watch the Throne” came out. That was a big thing for us. And we almost tripled in size during Y Combinator, which was a lot of growth.', '', 'Andrew: What’s “Watch the Throne”? I should know that, but I don’t.', '', 'Tom: “Watch the Throne” was this Jay-Z, Kanye West joint project in November 2011. Great album.', '', 'Andrew: Okay. You then got was it, Beta Works, that came in as an investor right afterwards?', '', 'Tom: Yeah. I guess we’re really not a crunch-based.', '', 'Andrew: Yeah. I don’t know that this is actually, yeah, is Beta Works the next one?', '', 'Tom: We didn’t see [??]. It was actually about 16 or 17 or 18 different investors, including Beta Works. And we were hot and had interests. But it was still hard to raise money. It took us a long time. You know, you read these stories about, well I come here demoed in. You leave demoed in. You’ve got a bunch of signed whatevers and you’re good! At demo day. Not how it worked for us. It happens to some people like that.', '', 'So we raised about $1.8 million. But when we were raising it, it seemed like we were going to be able to raise 400K. And now we need more than this. We’re screwed! It was a hard process but we ended up doing it and raised a nice round and that lasted us for a little bit. Then we started fundraising almost immediately again because 1.8 million dollars seems like a lot but it doesn’t get you that far.', '', 'Then the second round of fundraising was a longer different process and that landed us with the $15 million from Ben Horowitz [SP] which was, you know, that was a nice little . . .', '', 'Andrew: That was when I felt that the startup world said, whoo! Right? Lyrics this big. What did you say to them? What did you show them that made them sign on?', '', ""Tom: One thing we said was, it was–okay, so you think this is totally ridiculous? Well we’ll go on stage in sunglasses and troll you even more. And that was a bad idea because Bewell[SP] totally did not get the joke, so. So we were like, Techron [SP] just robbed us, which is, like, this video shows up in the comment sections of any article or hacker news discussion about us with a probability of one. Its kind of like a [ratching of Godwin's Law thing]. It’s like, look at these fucking douches with sunglasses. It was a joke! But it was dumb."", '', 'But yeah, it’s tricky because when you want to say, look there’s this whole future world. When you get the money to do rap lyrics, when you get the money to do lyrics in general, you get the money for this broader idea of guiding you through and annotating and breaking down human culture.', '', 'We started with rap lyrics. It’s very, very hard. If you were saying build a website that all it does, it’s not that good, all it does is give you the best meeting and most interesting facts about every line in the history of rap. That’s all you have to do. That’s very hard to do in itself, but taking the sort of strengths and the software and the ideas that helped us build that and applying it to other places or what people were thinking.', '', 'And sometimes you tell people about that. But other times, whatever, the work should stand for itself. I’m not trying to tell people we’re going to do all this great stuff! And here’s where we are and how we got the money. It’s like, whatever, we’re going to try to do great stuff. You’ll see it when it happens. Stay tuned is kind of how I feel.', '', 'Andrew: Have you changed you attitude because of the flack you got from people asking are you crazy? Because it seems like it. It almost feels like it. It’s like you are apologizing for even wearing sunglasses at a conference. When to me, the attitude that you three have is one of the most exciting parts of your company.', '', ""Tom: I have no regrets. I think at the time I felt a little differently about it. My feeling on it is I think it is very important to not take yourself seriously. I think you’ve got to crack jokes. I haven’t been through that much, I don’t want to say I’ve been through a lot, but. I’ve been through some things and I’ve seen some crazy things happen, [it's called rap genius art] and that has made me feel it’s very important not to take yourself too seriously."", '', 'Now, the other side of the coin to that is you have to take your work very seriously. I think, why are we here doing this stuff. The work is the thing, you know? This goes beyond just like me wanting to build a project. This is how I think about relationships, how I think about friendships. I think the best way to relate to other people, to hang out with your friends is to be involved in a group project with them.', '', 'You’re spending all of your time working, so why don’t you spend your time with your friends. And when you’re sharing a struggle with someone, that’s how you get a deep bond with that person. So, work I take very, very seriously. And it pervades my life. So the problem is when you put on a display where you’re sort of not taking yourself seriously; your risk people thinking you don’t take the work seriously.', '', 'I think if you know me, if you’ve been at RapGenius and then you see me do something silly, you’re going to get one idea. But if you’ve never met me before, if you’ve never come to RapGenius and hung out with the talented editors and contributors and engineers here. And you see some display on [Tech Register], you’re going to get a wrong idea and that’s sad. I wish I could just crack a ton of jokes.', '', 'Andrew: Is that the part that really hurt you? It doesn’t feel like it was the tech-crunch part. It was something else that made you change. Was it Google banning you? What is it because I am sensing a different person?', '', 'Tom: I mean, I don’t know. I’m just trying to figure out the right way to convey to the world what rapping is about which is tricky. There are jokesters in a lot of ways, like, we are not, like the site has a lot of jokes. Jokes are in the culture, you know, I don’t take myself very seriously but that’s combined with very much of an obsessiveness about close reading and textual analysis, which is a weird combination to have in one person and in a group of people, in a company culture', '', 'And like expressing the multitudes we contain, like figuring out a way to express that is like the journey that we’re going through and I think we’ve gone down too far in one direction, then we’re going to go back and try to reach like a happy medium.', '', ""Andrew: And by the way, it’s more than the sunglasses, more than the clothes you wore, it’s more than the phone on stage. It was the things that you said and frankly, I’m not even going to get into this because I don’t think I can do this justice and that’s the part that draws me to you guys as much as the frickin' work."", '', 'I should never impose my point of view on an interview, I should try to bring out from you more of your thinking, more of who you are but as a fan of the site, as a fan of your personality, as a fan of someone who both grew up loving music and guys like the Beastie Boys who were irreverent and business, the combination of the two that I see in you guys makes me feel like ahh, this is the way I want to live my life, just not exactly saying the things you say, not looking like you do but being myself the way that you are and pushing it and having fun with it.', '', 'Tom: I appreciate that.', '', 'Andrew: You know what? I got to get off my soapbox. Let’s end it with this. Here’s something that I didn’t expect at all. We always ask guests do you have any books that you recommend because the audience ask for them. Most people have one book that they recommend. You gave us four different books, different kinds of books. I should probably talk about one but I have through all of them for a reason.', '', 'Tom: Sure.', '', 'Andrew: The first one, for tech you said ‘Code Complete’. Why?', '', 'Tom: So ‘Code Complete’ I read it way back when I first started programming on the referral of Jeff Atwood. It’s funny because Jeff Atwood, as an aside, like Jeff Atwood is a bit of a hero of mine, a big inspiration for Rap Genius was Stack Overflow and I kind of subliminally inspired by listening to every single Stack Overflow podcast.', '', 'So, you know, that was sick and it’s funny because Jeff Atwood is like a rap genius like hater and it’s tweets like anti-rap so he’s the one hater who I can’t like totally just let go off my back. Like I’m No, Jeff, don’t hate me. So Jeff don’t hate me, I love you dog. you’re a true inspiration to me.', '', 'But you inspired me to read Code Complete. What Code complete taught me was what software engineering is about because when think and when I used to think about computer programming I would think about like algorithms. Like, ok, what computer programming or software engineering is about is coming up with a better algorithm to like sort a list or do something else.', '', 'And what Code Complete taught me was that algorithms is totally a red herring, it’s not what software engineering is about at all. What software engineering is building complicated systems that are easy to maintain.', '', 'And so one principle of Code Complete that I remember is like a well- designed piece of software is one where you can make a change in one area with minimal knowledge of other pieces of functionality across the system and like stuff like that really was an eye opening experience in terms of what software engineering actually is versus what I originally perceived it to be.', '', 'Andrew: You know, that’s one of the reasons why I wanted to bring this up because the way you think comes through so much in your book recommendations, much more than I think any other question that I could ask.', '', 'For management you said “The Hard Things about Hard Things.” Why?', '', 'Tom Lehman: Ben Horowitz’s new book. I’m biased, obviously because Ben’s on our board and I’ve heard a lot about like sort of other versions of these stories and other stories. But yes, Ben Horowitz is someone who is down to talk about the fact that when you’re trying the entrepreneurship thing you’re going to cry, you’re going to puke, you’re going to throw up, you’re literally going to throw up. It’s so hard.', '', 'Andrew: Have you literally thrown up?', '', 'Tom: I have thrown up, absolutely.', '', 'Andrew: What made you throw up?', '', 'Tom: I don\'t know, maybe I haven\'t actually thrown up. I\'ve thrown up. You know, the stress of probably during like a fundraising type situation. Fundraising is one time where you can really seem like, ""we\'re great, we\'re screwed, we\'re great, we\'re screwed"". The Google thing, I didn\'t throw up during the Google thing, but I definitely experienced, uh, a lot of throw up type sweating patterns, but yeah.', '', 'Andrew: So does Ben make entrepreneurs throw up, and then he writes a book about how you have to throw up?', '', ""Tom: Well, he's just down to be real about the human side of this thing, which is that there's a very emotional human core to all of this, and you have to pay attention to that."", '', 'So, first of all, Ben is big on the talking, the communication aspect which you have to appreciate, like, one on ones. That was the influential to my thinking on this. You’ve got to do one on ones. You manage someone? You’ve got to do, at least, a biweekly one on one where you meet with them once every two weeks, at least, maybe once every week.', '', 'And you have an agenda, but at the end and throughout you say, “How do you feel? How do you really feel? What else is on your mind? You try to get people to say what they’re really thinking, and what they’re really thinking isn’t that I’m messing with this hard code problem.', '', 'But what they’re really thinking is the person who sits next to me is making me feel weird and this other thing. I feel weird about you and let’s talk about getting to the bottom of the emotional core. Like what’s actually going on in business even though people pretend that it’s not.', '', 'Andrew: The emotional core?', '', 'Tom: Yeah. It’s a big part of it.', '', 'Andrew: That’s one of my problems as an interviewer. People pretend that it’s not. I’ll talk to them on camera. They’ll pretend that it’s not. I will invite them afterwards to the office for scotch night, and sometimes they drink water, no scotch. So it’s not just the alcohol and then they open up about that. I’ll work on it. I’ve got time here. Let’s do two others real quick. “Infinite Jest” by David Foster Wallace. Why?', '', 'Tom: I love David Foster Wallace. First of all, obviously I’ve got his meme book, but David Foster Wallace just mirrors my passions, complicated fiction, the English language, like his — what was the essay he wrote on that review of Garner’s minor American usage. I forget the name of it, but that was well written.', '', ""Andrew: I don't know that."", '', 'Tom: But also he has this great interest in the philosophy of logic and the philosophy of math. He wrote this book “Everything and More” which is a good book but also I really have a lot of intellectual interest in combination with David Foster Wallace. “Infinite Jest” is this flawed monster masterpiece, but first of all it’s very readable, very, very funny and then also this subliminal idea of footnotes and annotations, context. This is this book that has hundreds of footnotes. It even took two bookmarks to read it.', '', 'And so David Foster Wallace is obsessed with footnotes, and this comes up in “Everything and More” as well. I think subliminally that kind of got the juices, the gears turning in my mind about annotation. Of course, “Infinite Jest” is not the same thing because the annotations are still part of the text. The annotations still exist within the fictional world.', '', 'So if David Foster Wallace verified annotations, they would be written by the author, David Foster Wallace who is explaining something about the work whereas the annotations, the footnotes in “Infinite Jest” is still within the text. So it’s a little different but still just breaking stuff down. You take a little thing, a little footnote and then it’s this huge expanse, this huge thing where you can really cash out what’s going on, that idea . . .', '', 'Andrew: I can understand now why you considered being a lawyer.', '', 'Tom: Right. Yes.', '', 'Andrew: All right, the final one is a book that I’ve been wanting to read ever since, I guess, college when a friend of mine started reading it, “Power Broker” but it’s so long that it’s intimidating. It’s not directly applicable to business, but it is still a very intellectual book that I think, “When am I going to have time to go through the “Power Broker?” You’re reading it now. You’re about halfway through. Why?', '', 'Tom: Well, first of all, a quick admission. I am listening to the audio book.', '', 'Andrew: Frankly, even the audio book intimidated me because of the size. What is it? It’s a 50 hour book, right?', '', 'Tom: It’s more than that. It’s like 60 or 70 hours. It’s very, very, very long, intimidating. It’s hard now since I live in the building in which I work I don’t have a commute, and I used to listen to it on the subway. But, yeah, it’s a great book about sort of . . .', '', 'Andrew: The man who shaped New York.', '', 'Tom: The man who shaped New York. Go on the West Side highway some time. Go drive any parkway. Part of what the “Power Broker” teaches you is kind of techniques in obtaining power, applying power. One great thing from that book is this great idea of how Robert Moses would get the money to build the Jones Beach recreation center, or whatever he would do. He’d say, “Give me a million dollars. That’s all I need for the project.”', '', 'And then he would break ground. He would start building and spend a million dollars and then he would go back and say, “I broke ground. I started building. Turns out I need $20 million.”', '', 'Andrew: [laughs]', '', 'Tom: Well then its like, ""fuck man, we gave you a million dollars."" Basically Robert Moses explicitly or implicitly would say, “Well, look, are you cutting off my funding and now the million dollars is going to go to waste and you’re going to look like idiots because you approved the project without knowing what it cost?', '', 'Andrew: [laughs]', '', 'Tom: It looks like put the shovel in the ground is his idea. I think they’re some truth to that, but it’s more about obtaining power and applying power is the lesson of what kind of person it turned you into to. Because if you look at Robert Moses and the type of person he was, both in the intensity of his drive and how he dealt with people on the job in his professional life. But also look at the way he treated his brother.', '', 'How calculating and cold he was in that thing. Was he ultimately happy? Is that a good way to live? I think about this in business a lot especially when you’re dealing with people outside of your company whether it’s a vendor or an investor or a counterpart in some deal.', '', 'The right approach is often to be very, very ruthless and push very, very hard and advocate very aggressively for your own interests. That is a hard thing to learn, especially if you’re fundamentally a nice person, which I think I basically am. I’m not trying to be mean. You have to train yourself to be really, really, really ruthless.', '', 'But the even more challenging thing is being able to do that in a business context without warping your brain into becoming like a ruthless, upset, mad person. If you have to work yourself up to get angry to negotiate with someone, and then you’re done negotiating and you go talk to your friend, you’re not going to be able to totally become un-angry. Or, maybe you can, then that also is creepy to some people.', '', 'Like, I’ll be in a mode where I’ll give someone extremely harsh feedback on something, and then see the person an hour later at a company event and be totally friendly with the person. That freaks people out. Being able to… Just thinking about that, I’m like what is the right way to orient yourself towards this thing given that to be successful you can’t just be nice to everyone all the time.', '', 'But, you probably don’t want to turn into someone like Robert Moses who was just 100% ruthless and total animal, but shaped New York.', '', 'Andrew: Shaped New York…', '', 'Tom: …[??]…', '', 'Andrew: In the end his legacy’s still there. Hey, before I end I want to say thank you to a Mixergy Premium member. The premium members are the ones who keep this thing going. In return for keeping this going, I give them the best freaking courses and interviews, the most research, the most prepared for that I possibly can.', '', 'I want to thank one of them. Mitch Roth is a Mixergy Premium member and has been for a while. When I asked him why he’s a premium member or what he got out of it, he said “I was able to gain confidence that I, too, can play a role of an entrepreneur and strike out on my own adventure.”', '', 'That’s one of the things that I got out of reading biographies when I started in business and still do to this day. I’m so proud that I can contribute that to Mitch and to all these premium members. If you’re not a premium member, go sign up at mixergypremium.com.', '', 'Hey, Tom, how cool would it be if one day this whole interview, the transcript of it, could be annotated? Like, every part, including the part where I didn’t ask a question all the way through, and someone could explain what I was getting at. Or, where I didn’t quote what you were saying, but someone could explain what I was… I would love that.', '', 'Tom: Let’s do it! For real. I mean I think on your site, right, you have the transcripts there.', '', 'Andrew: Yeah. I’ll give you the transcript, but I don’t know that anyone would care about this.', '', 'You know, one of my disappointments is the kind of music that I’m passionate about, when I go to RapGenius there’s not enough on there. I almost would rather people would focus on the old… What trips me up? Like, I’ll suddenly get into heavy metal. An old heavy metal wouldn’t necessarily be complete.', '', 'I would love for people even to complete that before they get to Mixergy. But, if they could annotate Mixergy, oh, I would love it.', '', 'Tom: Let’s do it. If you were interviewing Kanye West it would definitely get annotated, or Obama it would definitely get heavily annotated. With me, maybe less so, but I’m going to throw some annotation.', '', 'We can put some verified annotations on there. So, if someone watches the show, if you’re watching this right now… How about that? If you’re watching this right now, head over to RapGenius and search for it and you’ll see the behind the scenes stuff.', '', 'Andrew: I would love that.', '', 'Tom: …[??]…', '', 'Andrew: And I will come in and I will annotate along with people. But, I’d like someone else in the audience or someone to… Yeah, someone in the audience to help get this going so it’s not like my project just for myself.', '', 'I want to see that they care. I would love that. I think that there’s room to go beyond music into annotating thoughts. What did we miss? What didn’t we get into? You guys are welcome to copy this and do whatever you want with this.', '', 'Thank you so much for doing this interview. I’ve been a big fan. I ran over when I saw that you were on the agenda right now, because I just freaking love the product. I love the product.', '', 'Tom: I appreciate that. Thanks. Well, you know, I appreciate the love, and I appreciate that you like some of the crazy vibes we’ve put out in the past. You know, there’s more craziness to come…', '', 'Andrew: I hate that you say “in the past.” It hurts me to hear that. It hurts me to hear that…', '', 'Tom: Well…', '', 'Andrew: …It feels…', '', 'Tom: Recently and not so recently. But, more craziness is to come. I promise.', '', 'Andrew: I would like that. I mean I just don’t want to see… RapGenius, I think the founders, this is… I don’t care if it sounds like I’m kissing butt. There’s no reason for doing it, because we’re at the end of the freaking interview. I think people are missing the point.', '', 'I think if you’re really into music, I think if you’re specifically maybe into the kind of music I am, there’s a meaning behind music. When there isn’t meaning I don’t give a rat’s ass about it. But, when there’s meaning about it it’s a form of self expression, a form of inner depth, a form of leaving your mark on the world.', '', 'And, when I see the way that you guys carry yourselves I feel like you’re doing it. No more than you can say the Beastie Boys stink because of this line that they said about girls should do the laundry. You can’t analyze them based on that. You have to take them complete with who they are, the time they’re in, and the message that they have to communicate.', '', 'I feel the same thing needs to be done with entrepreneurs. Frankly, if you guys start to hold back, what the hell’s the point for the rest of us? Right?', '', 'Tom: True. It’s our responsibility. I’ll…', '', 'Andrew: Please carry that responsibility to the whole. Otherwise, we’re all dead.', '', 'Tom: Whew.', '', 'Andrew: All right. Thank you so much for doing this interview.', '', 'Tom: Oh, it was great. Thanks for having me.', '', 'Andrew: You bet.', '', 'Tom: Can’t wait to see it.', '', 'Andrew: Thank you.', '', 'Tom: Yeah.', '', 'Andrew: Thank you. Thank you all for being a part of it.

Guess the cylinders are jam-cram-full of carbon again. Don't know but what maybe I'll have to put in another set of piston-rings.”"", '', ""He stopped on Main Street and clucked hospitably, “There, that'll give you just a block to walk. G' night.”"", '', 'Carol was in suspense. Would Erik sneak away?', '', ""He stolidly moved to the back of the car, thrust in his hand, muttered, “Good night—Carol. I'm glad we had our walk.” She pressed his hand. The car was flapping on. He was hidden from her—by a corner drug store on Main Street!"", '', ""Kennicott did not recognize her till he drew up before the house. Then he condescended, “Better jump out here and I'll take the boat around back. Say, see if the back door is unlocked, will you?” She unlatched the door for him. She realized that she still carried the damp glove she had stripped off for Erik. She drew it on. She stood in the center of the living-room, unmoving, in damp coat and muddy rubbers. Kennicott was as opaque as ever. Her task wouldn't be anything so lively as having to endure a scolding, but only an exasperating effort to command his attention so that he would understand the nebulous things she had to tell him, instead of interrupting her by yawning, winding the clock, and going up to bed. She heard him shoveling coal into the furnace. He came through the kitchen energetically, but before he spoke to her he did stop in the hall, did wind the clock."", '', 'He sauntered into the living-room and his glance passed from her drenched hat to her smeared rubbers. She could hear—she could hear, see, taste, smell, touch—his “Better take your coat off, Carrie; looks kind of wet.” Yes, there it was:', '', ""“Well, Carrie, you better——” He chucked his own coat on a chair, stalked to her, went on with a rising tingling voice, “——you better cut it out now. I'm not going to do the out-raged husband stunt. I like you and I respect you, and I'd probably look like a boob if I tried to be dramatic. But I think it's about time for you and Valborg to call a halt before you get in Dutch, like Fern Mullins did.”"", '', '“Do you——”', '', ""“Course. I know all about it. What d' you expect in a town that's as filled with busybodies, that have plenty of time to stick their noses into other folks' business, as this is? Not that they've had the nerve to do much tattling to me, but they've hinted around a lot, and anyway, I could see for myself that you liked him. But of course I knew how cold you were, I knew you wouldn't stand it even if Valborg did try to hold your hand or kiss you, so I didn't worry. But same time, I hope you don't suppose this husky young Swede farmer is as innocent and Platonic and all that stuff as you are! Wait now, don't get sore! I'm not knocking him. He isn't a bad sort. And he's young and likes to gas about books. Course you like him. That isn't the real rub. But haven't you just seen what this town can do, once it goes and gets moral on you, like it did with Fern? You probably think that two young folks making love are alone if anybody ever is, but there's nothing in this town that you don't do in company with a whole lot of uninvited but awful interested guests. Don't you realize that if Ma Westlake and a few others got started they'd drive you up a tree, and you'd find yourself so well advertised as being in love with this Valborg fellow that you'd HAVE to be, just to spite 'em!”"", '', '“Let me sit down,” was all Carol could say. She drooped on the couch, wearily, without elasticity.', '', 'He yawned, “Gimme your coat and rubbers,” and while she stripped them off he twiddled his watch-chain, felt the radiator, peered at the thermometer. He shook out her wraps in the hall, hung them up with exactly his usual care. He pushed a chair near to her and sat bolt up. He looked like a physician about to give sound and undesired advice.', '', 'Before he could launch into his heavy discourse she desperately got in, “Please! I want you to know that I was going to tell you everything, tonight.”', '', ""“Well, I don't suppose there's really much to tell.”"", '', ""“But there is. I'm fond of Erik. He appeals to something in here.” She touched her breast. “And I admire him. He isn't just a 'young Swede farmer.' He's an artist——”"", '', ""“Wait now! He's had a chance all evening to tell you what a whale of a fine fellow he is. Now it's my turn. I can't talk artistic, but——Carrie, do you understand my work?” He leaned forward, thick capable hands on thick sturdy thighs, mature and slow, yet beseeching. “No matter even if you are cold, I like you better than anybody in the world. One time I said that you were my soul. And that still goes. You're all the things that I see in a sunset when I'm driving in from the country, the things that I like but can't make poetry of. Do you realize what my job is? I go round twenty-four hours a day, in mud and blizzard, trying my damnedest to heal everybody, rich or poor. You—that 're always spieling about how scientists ought to rule the world, instead of a bunch of spread-eagle politicians—can't you see that I'm all the science there is here? And I can stand the cold and the bumpy roads and the lonely rides at night. All I need is to have you here at home to welcome me. I don't expect you to be passionate—not any more I don't—but I do expect you to appreciate my work. I bring babies into the world, and save lives, and make cranky husbands quit being mean to their wives. And then you go and moon over a Swede tailor because he can talk about how to put ruchings on a skirt! Hell of a thing for a man to fuss over!”"", '', ""She flew out at him: “You make your side clear. Let me give mine. I admit all you say—except about Erik. But is it only you, and the baby, that want me to back you up, that demand things from me? They're all on me, the whole town! I can feel their hot breaths on my neck! Aunt Bessie and that horrible slavering old Uncle Whittier and Juanita and Mrs. Westlake and Mrs. Bogart and all of them. And you welcome them, you encourage them to drag me down into their cave! I won't stand it! Do you hear? Now, right now, I'm done. And it's Erik who gives me the courage. You say he just thinks about ruches (which do not usually go on skirts, by the way!). I tell you he thinks about God, the God that Mrs. Bogart covers up with greasy gingham wrappers! Erik will be a great man some day, and if I could contribute one tiny bit to his success——”"", '', ""“Wait, wait, wait now! Hold up! You're assuming that your Erik will make good. As a matter of fact, at my age he'll be running a one-man tailor shop in some burg about the size of Schoenstrom.”"", '', '“He will not!”', '', ""“That's what he's headed for now all right, and he's twenty-five or -six and——What's he done to make you think he'll ever be anything but a pants-presser?”"", '', '“He has sensitiveness and talent——”', '', ""“Wait now! What has he actually done in the art line? Has he done one first-class picture or—sketch, d' you call it? Or one poem, or played the piano, or anything except gas about what he's going to do?”"", '', 'She looked thoughtful.', '', ""“Then it's a hundred to one shot that he never will. Way I understand it, even these fellows that do something pretty good at home and get to go to art school, there ain't more than one out of ten of 'em, maybe one out of a hundred, that ever get above grinding out a bum living—about as artistic as plumbing. And when it comes down to this tailor, why, can't you see—you that take on so about psychology—can't you see that it's just by contrast with folks like Doc McGanum or Lym Cass that this fellow seems artistic? Suppose you'd met up with him first in one of these reg'lar New York studios! You wouldn't notice him any more 'n a rabbit!”"", '', 'She huddled over folded hands like a temple virgin shivering on her knees before the thin warmth of a brazier. She could not answer.', '', ""Kennicott rose quickly, sat on the couch, took both her hands. “Suppose he fails—as he will! Suppose he goes back to tailoring, and you're his wife.

He's in some bum shack, pressing pants all day, or stooped over sewing, and having to be polite to any grouch that blows in and jams a dirty stinking old suit in his face and says, 'Here you, fix this, and be blame quick about it.' He won't even have enough savvy to get him a big shop. He'll pike along doing his own work—unless you, his wife, go help him, go help him in the shop, and stand over a table all day, pushing a big heavy iron. Your complexion will look fine after about fifteen years of baking that way, won't it! And you'll be humped over like an old hag. And probably you'll live in one room back of the shop. And then at night—oh, you'll have your artist—sure! He'll come in stinking of gasoline, and cranky from hard work, and hinting around that if it hadn't been for you, he'd of gone East and been a great artist. Sure! And you'll be entertaining his relatives——Talk about Uncle Whit! You'll be having some old Axel Axelberg coming in with manure on his boots and sitting down to supper in his socks and yelling at you, 'Hurry up now, you vimmin make me sick!' Yes, and you'll have a squalling brat every year, tugging at you while you press clothes, and you won't love 'em like you do Hugh up-stairs, all downy and asleep——”"", '', '“Please! Not any more!”', '', 'Her face was on his knee.', '', ""He bent to kiss her neck. “I don't want to be unfair. I guess love is a great thing, all right.

All day she tried to devise a way of giving Erik up. Telephone? The village central would unquestionably “listen in.” A letter? It might be found. Go to see him? Impossible.

,,"['To start with, look at all the books. There were her Edith Wharton novels, arranged not by title but date of publication; there was the complete Modern Library set of Henry James, a gift from her father on her twenty-first birthday; there were the dog-eared paperbacks assigned in her college courses, a lot of Dickens, a smidgen of Trollope, along with good helpings of Austen, George Eliot, and the redoubtable Brontë sisters.', '', 'There were a whole lot of black-and-white New Directions paperbacks, mostly poetry by people like H.D. or Denise Levertov.There were the Colette novels she read on the sly.', '', 'There was the first edition of Couples, belonging to her mother, which Madeleine had surreptitiously dipped into back in sixth grade and which she was using now to provide textual support in her English honors thesis on the marriage plot.', '', 'There was, in short, this mid-size but still portable library representing pretty much everything Madeleine had read in college, a collection of texts, seemingly chosen at random, whose focus slowly narrowed, like a personality test, a sophisticated one you couldn’t trick by anticipating the implications of its questions and finally got so lost in that your only recourse was to answer the simple truth.', '', 'And then you waited for the result, hoping for “Artistic,” or “Passionate,” thinking you could live with “Sensitive,” secretly fearing “Narcissistic” and “Domestic,” but finally being presented with an outcome that cut both ways and made you feel different depending on the day, the hour, or the guy you happened to be dating: “Incurably Romantic.”', '', 'These were the books in the room where Madeleine lay, with a pillow over her head, on the morning of her college graduation. She’d read each and every one, often multiple times, frequently underlining passages, but that was no help to her now.', '', 'Madeleine was trying to ignore the room and everything in it. She was hoping to drift back down into the oblivion where she’d been safely couched for the last three hours.', '', 'Any higher level of wakefulness would force her to come to grips with certain disagreeable facts: for instance, the amount and variety of the alcohol she’d imbibed last night, and the fact that she’d gone to sleep with her contacts in.', '', 'Thinking about such specifics would, in turn, call to mind the reasons she’d drunk so much in the first place, which she definitely didn’t want to do. And so Madeleine adjusted her pillow, blocking out the early morning light, and tried to fall back to sleep.', '', 'But it was useless. Because right then, at the other end of her apartment, the doorbell began to ring.', '', 'Early June, Providence, Rhode Island, the sun up for almost two hours already, lighting up the pale bay and the smokestacks of the Narragansett Electric factory, rising like the sun on the Brown University seal emblazoned on all the pennants and banners draped up over campus, a sun with a sagacious face, representing knowledge.', '', 'But this sun—the one over Providence—was doing the metaphorical sun one better, because the founders of the university, in their Baptist pessimism, had chosen to depict the light of knowledge enshrouded by clouds, indicating that ignorance had not yet been dispelled from the human realm, whereas the actual sun was just now fighting its way through cloud cover, sending down splintered beams of light and giving hope to the squadrons of parents, who’d been soaked and frozen all weekend, that the unseasonable weather might not ruin the day’s festivities.', '', 'All over College Hill, in the geometric gardens of the Georgian mansions, the magnolia-scented front yards of Victorians, along brick sidewalks running past black iron fences like those in a Charles Addams cartoon or a Lovecraft story; outside the art studios at the Rhode Island School of Design, where one painting major, having stayed up all night to work, was blaring Patti Smith; shining off the instruments (tuba and trumpet, respectively) of the two members of the Brown marching band who had arrived early at the meeting point and were nervously looking around, wondering where everyone else was; brightening the cobblestone side streets that led downhill to the polluted river, the sun was shining on every brass doorknob, insect wing, and blade of grass.', 'And, in concert with the suddenly flooding light, like a starting gun for all the activity, the doorbell in Madeleine’s fourth-floor apartment began, clamorously, insistently, to ring.', '', 'The pulse reached her less as a sound than as a sensation, an electric shock shooting up her spine. In one motion Madeleine tore the pillow off her head and sat up in bed. She knew who was ringing the buzzer.', '', 'It was her parents. She’d agreed to meet Alton and Phyllida for breakfast at 7:30. She’d made this plan with them two months ago, in April, and now here they were, at the appointed time, in their eager, dependable way.', '', 'That Alton and Phyllida had driven up from New Jersey to see her graduate, that what they were here to celebrate today wasn’t only her achievement but their own as parents, had nothing wrong or unexpected about it.', '', 'The problem was that Madeleine, for the first time in her life, wanted no part of it. She wasn’t proud of herself. She was in no mood to celebrate. She’d lost faith in the significance of the day and what the day represented.', '', 'She considered not answering. But she knew that if she didn’t answer, one of her roommates would, and then she’d have to explain where she’d disappeared to last night, and with whom. Therefore, Madeleine slid out of the bed and reluctantly stood up.', '', 'This seemed to go well for a moment, standing up. Her head felt curiously light, as if hollowed out. But then the blood, draining from her skull like sand from an hourglass, hit a bottleneck, and the back of her head exploded in pain.', '', 'In the midst of this barrage, like the furious core from which it emanated, the buzzer erupted again.', '', 'She came out of her bedroom and stumbled in bare feet to the intercom in the hall, slapping the SPEAK button to silence the buzzer.', '', '“Hello?”', '', '“What’s the matter? Didn’t you hear the bell?” It was Alton’s voice, as deep and commanding as ever, despite the fact that it was issuing from a tiny speaker.', '', '“Sorry,” Madeleine said. “I was in the shower.”', '', '“Likely story. Will you let us in, please?”', 'Madeleine didn’t want to. She needed to wash up first.', '', '“I’m coming down,” she said.', '', 'This time, she held down the SPEAK button too long, cutting off Alton’s response. She pressed it again and said, “Daddy?” but while she was speaking, Alton must have been speaking, too, because when she pressed LISTEN all that came through was static.', '', 'Madeleine took this pause in communications to lean her forehead against the door frame. The wood felt nice and cool.', '', 'The thought struck her that, if she could keep her face pressed against the soothing wood, she might be able to cure her headache, and if she could keep her forehead pressed against the door frame for the rest of the day, while somehow still being able to leave the apartment, she might make it through breakfast with her parents, march in the commencement procession, get a diploma, and graduate.', '', 'She lifted her face and pressed speak again.', '', '“Daddy?”', '', 'But it was Phyllida’s voice that answered. “Maddy? What’s the matter? Let us in.”', '', '“My roommates are still asleep. I’m coming down. Don’t ring the bell anymore.”', '', '“We want to see your apartment!”', '', '“Not now. I’m coming down. Don’t ring.”', '', 'She took her hand from the buttons and stood back, glaring at the intercom as if daring it to make a sound. When it didn’t, she started back down the hall. She was halfway to the bathroom when her roommate Abby emerged, blocking the way.', '', 'She yawned, running a hand through her big hair, and then, noticing Madeleine, smiled knowingly.', '“So,” Abby said, “where did you sneak off to last night?”', '', '“My parents are here,” Madeleine said. “I have to go to breakfast.”', '', '“Come on. Tell me.”', '', '“There’s nothing to tell. I’m late.”', '', '“How come you’re wearing the same clothes, then?”', '', 'Instead of replying, Madeleine looked down at herself. Ten hours earlier, when she’d borrowed the black Betsey Johnson dress from Olivia, Madeleine had thought it looked good on her. But now the dress felt hot and sticky, the fat leather belt looked like an S&M restraint, and there was a stain near the hem that she didn’t want to identify.', '', 'Abby, meanwhile, had knocked on Olivia’s door and entered. “So much for Maddy’s broken heart,” she said. “Wake up! You’ve got to see this.”', '', 'The path to the bathroom was clear. Madeleine’s need for a shower was extreme, almost medical. At a minimum, she had to brush her teeth.', '', 'But Olivia’s voice was audible now. Soon Madeleine would have two roommates interrogating her. Her parents were liable to start ringing again any minute. As quietly as possible, she inched back down the hall.', '', 'She stepped into a pair of loafers left by the front door, crushing the heels flat as she caught her balance, and escaped into the outer corridor.', '', 'The elevator was waiting at the end of the floral runner. Waiting, Madeleine realized, because she’d failed to close the sliding gate when she’d staggered out of the thing a few hours earlier.', '', 'Now she shut the gate securely and pressed the button for the lobby, and with a jolt the antique contraption began to descend through the building’s interior gloom.', '', 'Madeleine’s building, a Neo-Romanesque castle called the Narragansett that wrapped around the plunging corner of Benefit Street and Church Street, had been built at the turn of the century.', '', 'Among its surviving period details—the stained-glass skylight, the brass wall sconces, the marble lobby—was the elevator. Made of curving metal bars like a giant birdcage, the elevator miraculously still functioned, but it moved slowly, and as the car dropped, Madeleine took the opportunity to make herself more presentable.', '', 'She ran her hands through her hair, finger-combing it. She polished her front teeth with her index finger. She rubbed mascara crumbs from her eyes and moistened her lips with her tongue. Finally, passing the balustrade on the second floor, she checked her reflection in the small mirror attached to the rear panel.', '', 'One of the nice things about being twenty-two, or about being Madeleine Hanna, was that three weeks of romantic anguish, followed by a night of epic drinking, didn’t do much visible damage. Except for puffiness around her eyes, Madeleine looked like the same pretty, dark-haired person as usual.', '', 'The symmetries of her face—the straight nose, the Katharine Hepburn–ish cheekbones and jawline—were almost mathematical in their precision. Only the slight furrow in her brow gave evidence of the slightly anxious person that Madeleine felt herself, intrinsically, to be.', '', 'She could see her parents waiting below. They were trapped between the lobby door and the door to the street, Alton in a seersucker jacket,', '', 'Phyllida in a navy suit and matching gold-buckled purse. For a second, Madeleine had an impulse to stop the elevator and leave her parents stuck in the foyer amid all the college-town clutter—the posters for New Wave bands with names like Wretched Misery or the Clits, the pornographic Egon Schiele drawings by the RISD kid on the second floor, all the clamorous Xeroxes whose subtext conveyed the message that the wholesome, patriotic values of her parents’ generation were now on the ash heap of history, replaced by a nihilistic, post-punk sensibility that Madeleine herself didn’t understand but was perfectly happy to scandalize her parents by pretending that she did—before the elevator stopped in the lobby and she slid open the gate and stepped out to meet them.', '', 'Alton was first through the door. “Here she is!” he said avidly. “The college graduate!” In his net-charging way, he surged forward to seize her in a hug. Madeleine stiffened, worried that she smelled of alcohol or, worse, of sex.', '', '“I don’t know why you wouldn’t let us see your apartment,” Phyllida said, coming up next. “I was looking forward to meeting Abby and Olivia. We’d love to treat them to dinner later.”', '', '“We’re not staying for dinner,” Alton reminded her.', '', '“Well, we might. That depends on Maddy’s schedule.”', '', '“No, that’s not the plan. The plan is to see Maddy for breakfast and then leave after the ceremony.”', '', '“Your father and his plans,” Phyllida said to Madeleine. “Are you wearing that dress to the ceremony?”', '', '“I don’t know,” Madeleine said.', '', '“I can’t get used to these shoulder pads all the young women are wearing. They’re so mannish.”', '', '“It’s Olivia’s.”', '', '“You look pretty whacked out, Mad,” Alton said. “Big party last night?”', '', '“Not really.”', '', '“Don’t you have anything of your own to wear?” Phyllida said.', '', '“I’ll have my robe on, Mummy,” Madeleine said, and, to forestall further inspection, headed past them through the foyer.', '', 'Outside, the sun had lost its battle with the clouds and vanished. The weather looked not much better than it had all weekend. Campus Dance, on Friday night, had been more or less rained out. The Baccalaureate service on Sunday had proceeded under a steady drizzle.', '', 'Now, on Monday, the rain had stopped, but the temperature felt closer to St. Patrick’s than to Memorial Day.', '', 'As she waited for her parents to join her on the sidewalk, it occurred to Madeleine that she hadn’t had sex, not really. This was some consolation.', '', '“Your sister sends her regrets,” Phyllida said, coming out.', '', '“She has to take Richard the Lionhearted for an ultrasound today.”', '', 'Richard the Lionhearted was Madeleine’s nine-week-old nephew. Everyone else called him Richard.', '', '“What’s the matter with him?” Madeleine asked.', '', '“One of his kidneys is petite, apparently. The doctors want to keep an eye on it. If you ask me, all these ultrasounds do is find things to worry about.”', '', '“Speaking of ultrasounds,” Alton said, “I need to get one on my knee.”', '', 'Phyllida paid no attention. “Anyway, Allie’s devastated not to see you graduate. As is Blake. But they’re hoping you and your new beau might visit them this summer, on your way to the Cape.”', '', 'You had to stay alert around Phyllida. Here she was, ostensibly talking about Richard the Lionhearted’s petite kidney, and already she’d managed to move the subject to Madeleine’s new boyfriend, Leonard (whom Phyllida and Alton hadn’t met), and to Cape Cod (where Madeleine had announced plans to cohabitate with him). On a normal day, when her brain was working, Madeleine would have been able to keep one step ahead of Phyllida, but this morning the best she could manage was to let the words float past her.', '', 'Fortunately, Alton changed the subject. “So, where do you recommend for breakfast?”', '', 'Madeleine turned and looked vaguely down Benefit Street. “There’s a place this way.”', '', 'She started shuffling along the sidewalk. Walking—moving—seemed like a good idea. She led them past a line of quaint, nicely maintained houses bearing historical placards, and a big apartment building with a gable roof. Providence was a corrupt town, crime-ridden and mob-controlled, but up on College Hill this was hard to see.', '', 'The sketchy downtown and dying or dead textile mills lay below, in the grim distance. Here the narrow streets, many of them cobblestone, climbed past mansions or snaked around Puritan graveyards full of headstones as narrow as heaven’s door, streets with names like Prospect, Benevolent, Hope, and Meeting, all of them feeding into the arboreous campus at the top.', '', 'The sheer physical elevation suggested an intellectual one.', '', '“Aren’t these slate sidewalks lovely,” Phyllida said as she followed along.', '', '“We used to have slate sidewalks on our street.', '', 'They’re much more attractive. But then the borough replaced them with concrete.”', '', '“Assessed us for the bill, too,”', '', 'Alton said. He was limping slightly, bringing up the rear. The right leg of his charcoal trousers was swelled from the knee brace he wore on and off the tennis court. Alton had been club champion in his age group for twelve years running, one of those older guys with a sweatband ringing a balding crown, a choppy forehand, and absolute murder in his eyes.', '', 'Madeleine had been trying to beat Alton her entire life without success. This was even more infuriating because she was better than he was, at this point. But whenever she took a set from Alton he started intimidating her, acting mean, disputing calls, and her game fell apart.', '', 'Madeleine was worried that there was something paradigmatic in this, that she was destined to go through life being cowed by less capable men.', '', 'As a result, Madeleine’s tennis matches against Alton had assumed such outsize personal significance for her that she got tight whenever she played him, with predictable results.', '', 'And Alton still gloated when he won, still got all rosy and jiggly, as if he’d bested her by sheer talent.', '', 'At the corner of Benefit and Waterman, they crossed behind the white steeple of First Baptist Church. In preparation for the ceremony, loudspeakers had been set up on the lawn.', '', 'A man wearing a bow tie, a dean-of-students-looking person, was tensely smoking a cigarette and inspecting a raft of balloons tied to the churchyard fence.', '', 'By now Phyllida had caught up to Madeleine, taking her arm to negotiate the uneven slate, which was pushed up by the roots of gnarled plane trees that lined the curb. As a little girl, Madeleine had thought her mother pretty, but that was a long time ago. Phyllida’s face had gotten heavier over the years; her cheeks were beginning to sag like those of a camel. The conservative clothes she wore—the clothes of a philanthropist or lady ambassador—had a tendency to conceal her figure. Phyllida’s hair was where her power resided. It was expensively set into a smooth dome, like a band shell for the presentation of that long-running act, her face. For as long as Madeleine could remember, Phyllida had never been at a loss for words or shy about a point of etiquette. Among her friends Madeleine liked to make fun of her mother’s formality, but she often found herself comparing other people’s manners unfavorably with Phyllida’s.', '', 'And right now Phyllida was looking at Madeleine with the proper expression for this moment: thrilled by the pomp and ceremony, eager to put intelligent questions to any of Madeleine’s professors she happened to meet, or to trade pleasantries with fellow parents of graduating seniors.', '', 'In short, she was available to everyone and everything and in step with the social and academic pageantry, all of which exacerbated Madeleine’s feeling of being out of step, for this day and the rest of her life.', '', 'She plunged on, however, across Waterman Street, and up the steps of Carr House, seeking refuge and coffee.', '', 'The café had just opened. The guy behind the counter, who was wearing Elvis Costello glasses, was rinsing out the espresso machine.', '', 'At a table against the wall, a girl with stiff pink hair was smoking a clove cigarette and reading Invisible Cities. “Tainted Love” played from the stereo on top of the refrigerator.', '', 'Phyllida, holding her handbag protectively against her chest, had paused to peruse the student art on the walls: six paintings of small, skin-diseased dogs wearing bleach-bottle collars.', '', '“Isn’t this fun?” she said tolerantly.', '', '“La Bohème,” Alton said.', '', 'Madeleine installed her parents at a table near the bay window, as far away from the pink-haired girl as possible, and went up to the counter. The guy took his time coming over. She ordered three coffees—a large for her—and bagels. While the bagels were being toasted, she brought the coffees over to her parents.', '', 'Alton, who couldn’t sit at the breakfast table without reading, had taken a discarded Village Voice from a nearby table and was perusing it. Phyllida was staring overtly at the girl with pink hair.', '', '“Do you think that’s comfortable?” she inquired in a low voice.', '', 'Madeleine turned to see that the girl’s ragged black jeans were held together by a few hundred safety pins.', '', '“I don’t know, Mummy. Why don’t you go ask her?”', '', '“I’m afraid of getting poked.”', '', '“According to this article,” Alton said, reading the Voice, “homosexuality didn’t exist until the nineteenth century. It was invented. In Germany.”', '', 'The coffee was hot, and lifesavingly good. Sipping it, Madeleine began to feel slightly less awful.', '', 'After a few minutes, she went up to get the bagels.', '', 'They were a little burned, but she didn’t want to wait for new ones, and so brought them back to the table. After examining his with a sour expression, Alton began scraping it punitively with a plastic knife.', '', 'Phyllida asked, “So, are we going to meet Leonard today?”', '', '“I’m not sure,” Madeleine said.', '', '“Anything you want us to know about?”', '', '“No.”', '', '“Are you two still planning to live together this summer?”', '', 'By this time Madeleine had taken a bite of her bagel. And since the answer to her mother’s question was complicated—strictly speaking, Madeleine and Leonard weren’t planning on living together, because they’d broken up three weeks ago; despite this fact, however, Madeleine hadn’t given up hope of a reconciliation, and seeing as she’d spent so much effort getting her parents used to the idea of her living with a guy, and didn’t want to jeopardize that by admitting that the plan was off—she was relieved to be able to point at her full mouth, which prevented her from replying.', '', '“Well, you’re an adult now,” Phyllida said. “You can do what you like. Though, for the record, I have to say that I don’t approve.”', '', '“You’ve already gone on record about that,” Alton broke in.', '', '“Because it’s still a bad idea!” Phyllida cried. “I don’t mean the propriety of it. I’m talking about the practical problems.', '', 'If you move in with Leonard—or any young man—and he’s the one with the job, then you begin at a disadvantage.', '', 'What happens if you two don’t get along? Where are you then? You won’t have any place to live. Or anything to do.”', '', 'That her mother was correct in her analysis, that the predicament Phyllida warned Madeleine about was exactly the predicament she was already in, didn’t motivate Madeleine to register agreement.', '', '“You quit your job when you met me,” Alton said to Phyllida.', '', '“That’s why I know what I’m talking about.”', '', '“Can we change the subject?” Madeleine said at last, having swallowed her food.', '', '“Of course we can, sweetheart. That’s the last I’ll say about it. If your plans change, you can always come home. Your father and I would love to have you.”', '', '“Not me,” Alton said. “I don’t want her. Moving back home is always a bad idea. Stay away.”', '', '“Don’t worry,” Madeleine said. “I will.”', '', '“The choice is yours,” Phyllida said. “But if you do come home, you could have the loft. That way you can come and go as you like.”', '', 'To her surprise, Madeleine found herself contemplating this proposal.', '', 'Why not tell her parents everything, curl up in the backseat of the car, and let them take her home? She could move into her old bedroom, with the sleigh bed and the Madeline wallpaper.', '', 'She could become a spinster, like Emily Dickinson, writing poems full of dashes and brilliance, and never gaining weight.', '', 'Phyllida brought her out of this reverie.', '', '“Maddy?” she said. “Isn’t that your friend Mitchell?”', '', 'Madeleine wheeled in her seat. “Where?”', '', '“I think that’s Mitchell. Across the street.”', '', 'In the churchyard, sitting Indian-style in the freshly mown grass, Madeleine’s “friend” Mitchell Grammaticus was indeed there. His lips were moving, as if he was talking to himself.', '', '“Why don’t you invite him to join us?” Phyllida said.', '', '“Now?”', '', '“Why not? I’d love to see Mitchell.”', '', '“He’s probably waiting for his parents,” Madeleine said.', '', 'Phyllida waved, despite the fact that Mitchell was too far away to notice.', '', '“What’s he doing sitting on the ground?” Alton asked.', '', 'The three Hannas stared across the street at Mitchell in his half-lotus.', '', '“Well, if you’re not going to ask him, I will,” Phyllida finally said.', '', '“O.K.,” Madeleine said. “Fine. I’ll go ask him.”', '', 'The day was getting warmer, but not by much. Black clouds were massing in the distance as Madeleine came down the steps of Carr House and crossed the street into the churchyard.', '', 'Someone inside the church was testing the loudspeakers, fussily repeating, “Sussex, Essex, and Kent.

Now. Speaking to you.”', '', '“Under duress or as a change of policy?”', '', 'Madeleine shifted her weight, wrinkling her face unhappily. “Look. I’m really hungover. I barely slept last night. My parents have been here about ten minutes and they’re already driving me crazy. So if you could just come over and say hello, that would be great.”', '', 'Mitchell’s large emotional eyes blinked twice. He was wearing a vintage gabardine shirt, dark wool pants, and beat-up wingtips. Madeleine had never seen him in shorts or tennis shoes.', '', '“I’m sorry,” he said. “About what happened.”', '', '“Fine,” Madeleine said, looking away. “It doesn’t matter.”', '', '“I was just being my usual vile self.”', '', '“So was I.”', '', 'They were quiet a moment. Madeleine felt Mitchell’s eyes on her, and she crossed her arms over her chest.', '', 'What had happened was this: one night the previous December, in a state of anxiety about her romantic life, Madeleine had run into Mitchell on campus and brought him back to her apartment.', '', 'She’d needed male attention and had flirted with him, without entirely admitting it to herself. In her bedroom, Mitchell had picked up a jar of deep-heating gel on her desk, asking what it was for.', '', 'Madeleine had explained that people who were athletic sometimes got sore muscles. She understood that Mitchell might not have experienced this phenomenon, seeing as all he did was sit in the library, but he should take her word for it.', '', 'At that point, Mitchell had come up behind her and wiped a gob of heating gel behind her ear. Madeleine jumped up, shouting at Mitchell, and wiped the gunk off with a T-shirt. Though she was within her rights to be angry,', '', 'Madeleine also knew (even at the time) that she was using the incident as a pretext for getting Mitchell out of her bedroom and for covering up the fact that she’d been flirting with him in the first place.', '', 'The worst part of the incident was how stricken Mitchell had looked, as if he’d been about to cry. He kept saying he was sorry, he was just joking around, but she ordered him to leave.', '', 'In the following days, replaying the incident in her mind, Madeleine had felt worse and worse about it. She’d been on the verge of calling Mitchell to apologize when she’d received a letter from him, a highly detailed, cogently argued, psychologically astute, quietly hostile four-page letter, in which he called her a “cocktease” and claimed that her behavior that night had been “the erotic equivalent of bread and circus, with just the circus.”', '', 'The next time they’d run into each other, Madeleine had acted as if she didn’t know him, and they hadn’t spoken since.', '', 'Now, in the churchyard of First Baptist, Mitchell looked up at her and said, “O.K. Let’s go say hello to your parents.”', '', 'Phyllida was waving as they came up the steps. In the flirtatious voice she reserved for her favorite of Madeleine’s friends, she called out, “I thought that was you on the ground. You looked like a swami!”', '', '“Congratulations, Mitchell!” Alton said, heartily shaking Mitchell’s hand. “Big day today. One of the milestones. A new generation takes the reins.”', '', 'They invited Mitchell to sit down and asked him if he wanted anything to eat. Madeleine went back to the counter to get more coffee, glad to have Mitchell keeping her parents occupied. As she watched him, in his old man’s clothes, engaging Alton and Phyllida in conversation, Madeleine thought to herself, as she’d thought many times before, that Mitchell was the kind of smart, sane, parent-pleasing boy she should fall in love with and marry. That she would never fall in love with Mitchell and marry him, precisely because of this eligibility, was yet another indication, in a morning teeming with them, of just how screwed up she was in matters of the heart.', '', 'When she returned to the table, no one acknowledged her.', '', '“So, Mitchell,” Phyllida was asking, “what are your plans after graduation?”', '', '“My father’s been asking me the same question,” Mitchell answered. “For some reason he thinks Religious Studies isn’t a marketable degree.”', '', 'Madeleine smiled for the first time all day. “See? Mitchell doesn’t have a job lined up, either.”', '', '“Well, I sort of do,” Mitchell said.', '', '“You do not,” Madeleine challenged him.', '', '“I’m serious. I do.” He explained that he and his roommate, Larry Pleshette, had come up with a plan to fight the recession. As liberal-arts degree holders matriculating into the job market at a time when unemployment was at 9.5 percent, they had decided, after much consideration, to leave the country and stay away as long as possible.', '', 'At the end of the summer, after they’d saved up enough money, they were going to backpack through Europe. After they’d seen everything in Europe there was to see, they were going to fly to India and stay there as long as their money held out. The whole trip would take eight or nine months, maybe as long as a year.', '', '“You’re going to India?” Madeleine said. “That’s not a job.”', '', '“We’re going to be research assistants,” Mitchell said. “For Prof. Hughes.”', '', '“Prof. Hughes in the theater department?”', '', '“I saw a program about India recently,” Phyllida said. “It was terribly depressing. The poverty!”', '', '“That’s a plus for me, Mrs. Hanna,” Mitchell said. “I thrive in squalor.”', '', 'Phyllida, who couldn’t resist this sort of mischief, gave up her solemnity, rippling with amusement. “Then you’re going to the right place!”', '', '“Maybe I’ll take a trip, too,” Madeleine said in a threatening tone.', '', 'No one reacted. Instead Alton asked Mitchell, “What sort of immunizations do you need for India?”', '', '“Cholera and typhus. Gamma globulin’s optional.”', '', 'Phyllida shook her head. “Your mother must be worried sick.”', '', '“When I was in the service,” Alton said, “they shot us up with a million things. Didn’t even tell us what the shots were for.”', '', '“I think I’ll move to Paris,” Madeleine said in a louder voice. “Instead of getting a job.”', '', '“Mitchell,” Phyllida continued, “with your interest in religious studies, I’d think India would be a perfect fit.

We were in the receiving line. Must have been three hundred people at least. Anyway, when we finally got up to the Dalai Lama, I asked him,', '', '‘Are you any relation to Dolly Parton?’”', '', '“I was mortified!” Phyllida cried. “Absolutely mortified.”', '', '“Daddy,” Madeleine said, “you’re going to be late.”', '', '“What?”', '', '“You should get going if you want to get a good spot.”', '', 'Alton looked at his watch. “We’ve still got an hour.”', '', '“It gets really crowded,” Madeleine emphasized. “You should go now.”', '', 'Alton and Phyllida looked at Mitchell, as if they trusted him to advise them.

I could call the admissions department, but I don’t because I’m scared to find out that I’ve been rejected. As long as I don’t know, I still have hope.”', '', 'There was a moment before Mitchell spoke again. “You can come to India with me,” he said.', '', 'Madeleine opened one eye to see, through a whorl in her hair, that Mitchell wasn’t entirely joking.', '', '“It’s not even about grad school,” she said. Taking a deep breath, she confessed, “Leonard and I broke up.”', '', 'It felt deeply pleasurable to say this, to name her sadness, and so Madeleine was surprised by the coldness of Mitchell’s reply.', '', '“Why are you telling me this?” he said.', '', 'She lifted her head, brushing her hair out of her face. “I don’t know. You wanted to know what was the matter.”', '', '“I didn’t, actually. I didn’t even ask.”', '', '“I thought you might care,” Madeleine said. “Since you’re my friend.”', '', '“Right,” Mitchell said, his voice suddenly sarcastic.', '', '“Our wonderful friendship! Our ‘friendship’ isn’t a real friendship because it only works on your terms.', '', 'You set the rules, Madeleine. If you decide you don’t want to talk to me for three months, we don’t talk. Then you decide you do want to talk to me because you need me to entertain your parents—and now we’re talking again. We’re friends when you want to be friends, and we’re never more than friends because you don’t want to be. And I have to go along with that.”', '', '“I’m sorry,” Madeleine said, feeling put-upon and blindsided. “I just don’t like you that way.”', '', '“Exactly!” Mitchell cried. “You’re not attracted to me physically. O.K., fine. But who says I was ever attracted to you mentally?”', '', 'Madeleine reacted as if she’d been slapped. She was outraged, hurt, and defiant all at once.', '', '“You’re such a”—she tried to think of the worst thing to say—“you’re such a jerk!”', '', 'She was hoping to remain imperious, but her chest was stinging, and, to her dismay, she burst into tears.', '', 'Mitchell reached out to touch her arm, but Madeleine shook him off. Getting to her feet, trying not to look like someone angrily weeping, she went out the door and down the steps onto Waterman Street.', '', 'Confronted by the festive churchyard, she turned downhill toward the river. She wanted to get away from campus. Her headache had returned, her temples were throbbing, and as she looked up at the storm clouds massing over downtown like more bad things to come, she asked herself why everyone was being so mean to her.', '', '', '', 'Madeleine’s love troubles had begun at a time when the French theory she was reading deconstructed the very notion of love. Semiotics 211 was an upper-level seminar taught by a former English department renegade.', '', 'Michael Zipperstein had come to Brown thirty-two years earlier as a New Critic. He’d inculcated the habits of close reading and biography-free interpretation into three generations of students before taking a Road to Damascus sabbatical, in Paris, in 1975, where he’d met Roland Barthes at a dinner party and been converted, over cassoulet, to the new faith.', '', 'Now Zipperstein taught two courses in the newly created Program in Semiotics Studies: Introduction to Semiotic Theory in the fall and, in the spring, Semiotics 211. Hygienically bald, with a seaman’s mustacheless white beard, Zipperstein favored French fisherman’s sweaters and wide-wale corduroys. He buried people with his reading lists: in addition to all the semiotic big hitters—Derrida, Eco, Barthes—the students in Semiotics 211 had to contend with a magpie nest of reserve reading that included everything from Balzac’s Sarrasine to issues of Semiotext(e) to photocopied selections from E. M. Cioran, Robert Walser, Claude Levi-Strauss, Peter Handke, and Carl Van Vechten.', '', 'To get into the seminar, you had to submit to a one-on-one interview with Zipperstein during which he asked bland personal questions, such as what your favorite food or dog breed was, and made enigmatic Warholian remarks in response. This esoteric probing, along with Zipperstein’s guru’s dome and beard, gave his students a sense that they’d been spiritually vetted and were now—for two hours on Thursday afternoons, at least—part of a campus lit-crit elite.', '', 'Which was exactly what Madeleine wanted. She’d become an English major for the purest and dullest of reasons: because she loved to read.', '', 'The university’s “British and American Literature Course Catalog” was, for Madeleine, what its Bergdorf equivalent was for her roommates.', '', 'A course listing like “English 274: Lyly’s Euphues” excited Madeleine the way a pair of Fiorucci cowboy boots did Abby. “English 450A:', '', 'Hawthorne and James” filled Madeleine with an expectation of sinful hours in bed not unlike what Olivia got from wearing a Lycra skirt and leather blazer to Danceteria. Even as a girl in their house in Prettybrook, Madeleine wandered into the library, with its shelves of books rising higher than she could reach—newly purchased volumes such as Love Story or Myra Breckinridgethat exuded a faintly forbidden air, as well as venerable leather-bound editions of Fielding,', '', 'Thackeray, and Dickens—and the magisterial presence of all those potentially readable words stopped her in her tracks. She could scan book spines for as long as an hour. Her cataloging of the family’s holdings rivaled the Dewey decimal system in its comprehensiveness.', '', 'Madeleine knew right where everything was. The shelves near the fireplace held Alton’s favorites, biographies of American presidents and British prime ministers, memoirs by warmongering secretaries of state, novels about sailing or espionage by William F. Buckley, Jr. Phyllida’s books filled the left side of the bookcases leading up to the parlor, NYRB-reviewed novels and essay collections, as well as coffee-table volumes about English gardens or chinoiserie.', '', 'Even now, at bed-and-breakfasts or seaside hotels, a shelf full of forlorn books always cried out to Madeleine. She ran her fingers over their salt-spotted covers. She peeled apart pages made tacky by ocean air. She had no sympathy for paperback thrillers and detective stories.', '', 'It was the abandoned hardback, the jacketless 1931 Dial Press edition ringed with many a coffee cup, that pierced Madeleine’s heart. Her friends might be calling her name on the beach, the clambake already under way, but Madeleine would sit down on the bed and read for a little while to make the sad old book feel better. She had read Longfellow’s “Hiawatha” that way. She’d read James Fenimore Cooper. She’d read H. M. Pulham, Esquire by John P. Marquand.', '', 'And yet sometimes she worried about what those musty old books were doing to her. Some people majored in English to prepare for law school. Others became journalists. The smartest guy in the honors program, Adam Vogel, a child of academics, was planning on getting a Ph.D. and becoming an academic himself.', '', 'That left a large contingent of people majoring in English by default. Because they weren’t left-brained enough for science, because history was too dry, philosophy too difficult, geology too petroleum-oriented, and math too mathematical—because they weren’t musical, artistic, financially motivated, or really all that smart, these people were pursuing university degrees doing something no different from what they’d done in first grade: reading stories.', '', 'English was what people who didn’t know what to major in majored in.', '', 'Her junior year, Madeleine had taken an honors seminar called The Marriage Plot: Selected Novels of Austen, Eliot, and James.', '', 'The class was taught by K. McCall Saunders. Saunders was a seventy-nine-year-old New Englander. He had a long, horsey face and a moist laugh that exposed his gaudy dental work. His pedagogical method consisted of his reading aloud lectures he’d written twenty or thirty years earlier.', '', 'Madeleine stayed in the class because she felt sorry for Professor Saunders and because the reading list was so good. In Saunders’s opinion, the novel had reached its apogee with the marriage plot and had never recovered from its disappearance. In the days when success in life had depended on marriage, and marriage had depended on money, novelists had had a subject to write about. The great epics sang of war, the novel of marriage.', '', 'Sexual equality, good for women, had been bad for the novel. And divorce had undone it completely.', '', 'What would it matter whom Emma married if she could file for separation later?', '', 'How would Isabel Archer’s marriage to Gilbert Osmond have been affected by the existence of a prenup?', '', 'As far as Saunders was concerned, marriage didn’t mean much anymore, and neither did the novel. Where could you find the marriage plot nowadays? You couldn’t. You had to read historical fiction. You had to read non-Western novels involving traditional societies. Afghani novels, Indian novels. You had to go, literarily speaking, back in time.', '', 'Madeleine’s final paper for the seminar was titled “The Interrogative Mood: Marriage Proposals and the (Strictly Limited) Sphere of the Feminine.”', '', 'It had impressed Saunders so much that he’d asked Madeleine to come see him. In his office, which had a grandparental smell, he expressed his opinion that Madeleine might expand her paper into a senior honors thesis, along with his willingness to serve as her advisor.', '', 'Madeleine smiled politely. Professor Saunders specialized in the periods she was interested in, the Regency leading into the Victorian era. He was sweet, and learned, and it was clear from his unsubscribed office hours that no one else wanted him as an advisor, and so Madeleine had said yes, she would love to work with him on her senior thesis.', '', 'She used a line from Trollope’s Barchester Towers as an epigraph:', '', '“There is no happiness in love, except at the end of an English novel.”', '', 'Her plan was to begin with Jane Austen. After a brief examination of Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion, and Sense and Sensibility, all comedies, essentially, that ended with weddings, Madeleine was going to move on to the Victorian novel, where things got more complicated and considerably darker. Middlemarch and The Portrait of a Lady didn’t end with weddings.', '', 'They began with the traditional moves of the marriage plot—the suitors, the proposals, the misunderstandings—but after the wedding ceremony they kept on going. These novels followed their spirited, intelligent heroines, Dorothea Brooke and Isabel Archer, into their disappointing married lives, and it was here that the marriage plot reached its greatest artistic expression.', '', 'By 1900 the marriage plot was no more. Madeleine planned to end with a brief discussion of its demise.', '', 'In Sister Carrie, Dreiser had Carrie live adulterously with Drouet, marry Hurstwood in an invalid ceremony, and then run off to become an actress—and this was only in 1900! For a conclusion, Madeleine thought she might cite the wife-swapping in Updike.', '', 'That was the last vestige of the marriage plot: the persistence in calling it “wife-swapping” instead of “husband-swapping.” As if the woman were still a piece of property to be passed around.', '', 'Professor Saunders suggested that Madeleine look at historical sources. She’d obediently boned up on the rise of industrialism and the nuclear family, the formation of the middle class, and the Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857. But it wasn’t long before she’d become bored with the thesis. Doubts about the originality of her work nagged at her.', '', 'She felt as if she was regurgitating the arguments Saunders had made in his marriage plot seminar. Her meetings with the old professor were dispiriting, consisting of Saunders shuffling the pages she’d given him, pointing out various red marks he’d made in the margins.', '', 'Then one Sunday morning, before winter break, Abby’s boyfriend, Whitney, materialized at their kitchen table, reading something called Of Grammatology.', '', 'When Madeleine asked what the book was about, she was given to understand by Whitney that the idea of a book being “about” something was exactly what this book was against, and that, if it was “about” anything, then it was about the need to stop thinking of books as being about things.', '', 'Madeleine said she was going to make coffee. Whitney asked if she would make him some, too.', '', 'College wasn’t like the real world. In the real world people dropped names based on their renown.', '', 'In college, people dropped names based on their obscurity. Thus, in the weeks after this exchange with Whitney, Madeleine began hearing people saying “Derrida.” She heard them saying “Lyotard” and “Foucault” and “Deleuze” and “Baudrillard.”', '', 'That most of these people were those she instinctually disapproved of—upper-middle-class kids who wore Doc Martens and anarchist symbols—made Madeleine dubious about the value of their enthusiasm. But soon she noticed David Koppel, a smart and talented poet, also reading Derrida.', '', 'And Pookie Ames, who read slush for The Paris Review and whom Madeleine liked, was taking a course with Professor Zipperstein.', '', 'Madeleine had always been partial to grandiose professors, people like Sears Jayne who hammed it up in the classroom, reciting Hart Crane or', '', 'Anne Sexton in a gag voice. Whitney acted as though Professor Jayne was a joke. Madeleine didn’t agree. But after three solid years of taking literature courses, Madeleine had nothing like a firm critical methodology to apply to what she read.', '', 'Instead she had a fuzzy, unsystematic way of talking about books. It embarrassed her to hear the things people said in class. And the things she said. I felt that. It was interesting the way Proust. I liked the way Faulkner.', '', 'And when Olivia, who was tall and slim, with a long, aristocratic nose like a saluki, came in one day carrying Of Grammatology, Madeleine knew that what had been marginal was now mainstream.', '', '“What’s that book like?”', '', '“You haven’t read it?”', '', '“Would I be asking if I had?”', '', 'Olivia sniffed. “Aren’t we a little bitchy today?”', '', '“Sorry.”', '', '“Just kidding. It’s great. Derrida is my absolute god!”', '', 'Almost overnight it became laughable to read writers like Cheever or Updike, who wrote about the suburbia Madeleine and most of her friends had grown up in, in favor of reading the Marquis de Sade, who wrote about anally deflowering virgins in eighteenth-century France.', '', 'The reason de Sade was preferable was that his shocking sex scenes weren’t about sex but politics. They were therefore anti-imperialist, anti-bourgeois, anti-patriarchal, and anti-everything a smart young feminist should be against. Right up through her third year at college, Madeleine kept wholesomely taking courses like Victorian Fantasy: From Phantastes to The Water-Babies, but by senior year she could no longer ignore the contrast between the hard-up, blinky people in her Beowulf seminar and the hipsters down the hall reading Maurice Blanchot.', '', 'Going to college in the moneymaking eighties lacked a certain radicalism. Semiotics was the first thing that smacked of revolution. It drew a line; it created an elect; it was sophisticated and Continental; it dealt with provocative subjects, with torture, sadism, hermaphroditism—with sex and power.', '', 'Madeleine had always been popular at school. Years of being popular had left her with the reflexive ability to separate the cool from the uncool, even within subgroups, like the English department, where the concept of cool didn’t appear to obtain.', '', 'If Restoration drama was getting you down, if scanning Wordsworth was making you feel dowdy and ink-stained, there was another option. You could flee K. McCall Saunders and the old New Criticism. You could defect to the new imperium of Derrida and Eco. You could sign up for Semiotics 211 and find out what everyone else was talking about.', '', '', '', 'Semiotics 211 was limited to ten students. Of the ten, eight had taken Introduction to Semiotic Theory. This was visually apparent at the first class meeting.', '', 'Lounging around the seminar table, when Madeleine came into the room from the wintry weather outside, were eight people in black T-shirts and ripped black jeans. A few had razored off the necks or sleeves of their T-shirts. There was something creepy about one guy’s face—it was like a baby’s face that had grown whiskers—and it took Madeleine a full minute to realize that he’d shaved off his eyebrows.', '', 'Everyone in the room was so spectral-looking that Madeleine’s natural healthiness seemed suspect, like a vote for Reagan. She was relieved, therefore, when a big guy in a down jacket and snowmobile boots showed up and took the empty seat next to her. He had a cup of take-out coffee.', '', 'Zipperstein asked the students to introduce themselves and explain why they were taking the seminar.', '', 'The boy without eyebrows spoke up first. “Um, let’s see. I’m finding it hard to introduce myself, actually, because the whole idea of social introductions is so problematized.', '', 'Like, if I tell you that my name is Thurston Meems and that I grew up in Stamford, Connecticut, will you know who I am? O.K.', '', 'My name’s Thurston and I’m from Stamford, Connecticut. I’m taking this course because I read Of Grammatology last summer and it blew my mind.”', '', 'When it was the turn of the boy next to Madeleine, he said in a quiet voice that he was a double major (biology and philosophy) and had never taken a semiotics course before, that his parents had named him Leonard, that it had always seemed pretty handy to have a name, especially when you were being called to dinner, and that if anyone wanted to call him Leonard he would answer to it.', '', 'Leonard didn’t make another comment. During the rest of the class, he leaned back in his chair, stretching out his long legs. After he finished his coffee, he dug into his right snowmobile boot and, to Madeleine’s surprise, pulled out a tin of chewing tobacco. With two stained fingers, he placed a wad of tobacco in his cheek. For the next two hours, every minute or so, he spat, discreetly but audibly, into the cup.', '', 'Every week Zipperstein assigned one daunting book of theory and one literary selection. The pairings were eccentric if not downright arbitrary. (What did Saussure’s Writings in General Linguistics, for instance, have to do with Pynchon’s The Crying of Lot 49?) As for Zipperstein himself, he didn’t run the class so much as observe it from behind the one-way mirror of his opaque personality. He hardly said a word. He asked questions now and then to stimulate discussion, and often went to the window to gaze in the direction of Narragansett Bay, as if thinking about his wooden sloop in dry dock.', '', 'Three weeks into the course, on a February day of flurries and gray skies, they read Zipperstein’s own book, The Making of Signs, along with Peter Handke’s A Sorrow Beyond Dreams.', '', 'It was always embarrassing when professors assigned their own books. Even Madeleine, who found all the reading hard going, could tell that Zipperstein’s contribution to the field was reformulative and second-tier.', '', 'Everyone seemed a little hesitant when talking about The Making of Signs, so it was a relief when, after the break, they turned to the literary selection.', '', '“So,” Zipperstein asked, blinking behind his round wire-rims. “What did you make of the Handke?”', '', 'After a short silence, Thurston spoke up. “The Handke was totally dank and depressing,” he said. “I loved it.”', '', 'Thurston was a sly-looking boy with short, gelled hair. His eyebrowlessness, along with his pale complexion, gave his face a superintelligent quality, like a floating, disembodied brain.', '', '“Care to elaborate?” Zipperstein said.', '', '“Well, Professor, here’s a subject dear to my heart—offing yourself.” The other students tittered as Thurston warmed to his topic.', '', '“It’s purportedly autobiographical, this book. But I’d contend, with Barthes, that the act of writing is itself a fictionalization, even if you’re treating actual events.”', '', 'Bart. So that was how you pronounced it. Madeleine made a note, grateful to be spared humiliation.', '', 'Meanwhile Thurston was saying, “So Handke’s mother commits suicide and Handke sits down to write about it. He wants to be as objective as possible, to be totally—remorseless!”', '', 'Thurston stifled a smile. He aspired to be a person who would react to his own mother’s suicide with high-literary remorselessness, and his soft, young face lit up with pleasure. “Suicide is a trope,” he announced.', '', '“Especially in German literature. You’ve got The Sorrows of Young Werther. You’ve got Kleist. Hey, I just thought of something.” He held up a finger.', '', '“The Sorrows of Young Werther.” He held up another finger.', '', '“A Sorrow Beyond Dreams. My theory is that Handke felt the weight of all that tradition and this book was his attempt to break free.”', '', '“How do you mean ‘free’?” Zipperstein said.', '', '“From the whole Teutonic, Sturm-und-Drang, suicidal thing.”', '', 'The flurries swirling outside the windows looked like either flakes of soap or flash of ash, like something either very clean or very dirty.', '', '“The Sorrows of Young Werther is an apt reference,” Zipperstein said.', '', '“But I think that’s more the translator’s doing than Handke’s. In German the book’s called Wunschloses Unglück.”', '', 'Thurston smiled, either because he was pleased to be receiving Zipperstein’s full attention or because he thought German sounded funny.', '', '“It’s a play on a German saying, wunschlos glücklich, which means being happier than you could ever wish for. Only here Handke makes a nice reversal. It’s a serious and strangely wonderful title.”', '', '“So it means being unhappier than you could ever wish for,” Madeleine said.', '', 'Zipperstein looked at her for the first time.', '', '“In a sense. As I said, something is lost in translation. What was your take?”', '', '“On the book?” Madeleine asked, and immediately realized how stupid this sounded. She fell silent, the blood beating in her ears.', '', 'People blushed in nineteenth-century English novels but never in contemporary Austrian ones.', '', 'Before the silence became uncomfortable, Leonard came to her rescue.', '', '“I have a comment,” he said. “If I was going to write about my mother’s suicide, I don’t think I’d be too concerned about being experimental.” He leaned forward, putting his elbows on the table.', '', '“I mean, wasn’t anybody put off by Handke’s so-called remorselessness? Didn’t this book strike anyone as a tad cold?”', '', '“Better cold than sentimental,” Thurston said.', '', '“Do you think? Why?”', '', '“Because we’ve read the sentimental, filial account of a cherished dead parent before. We’ve read it a million times. It doesn’t have any power anymore.”', '', '“I’m doing a little thought experiment here,” Leonard said.', '', '“Say my mother killed herself. And say I wrote a book about it.', '', 'Why would I want to do something like that?” He closed his eyes and leaned his head back.', '', '“First, I’d do it to cope with my grief. Second, maybe to paint a portrait of my mother. To keep her alive in my memory.”', '', '“And you think your reaction is universal,” Thurston said.', '', '“That because you’d respond to the death of a parent a certain way, that obligates Handke to do the same.”', '', '“I’m saying that if your mother kills herself it’s not a literary trope.”', '', 'Madeleine’s heart had quieted now. She was listening to the discussion with interest.', '', 'Thurston was nodding his head in a way that somehow didn’t suggest agreement.', '', '“Yeah, O.K.,” he said. “Handke’s real mother killed herself. She died in a real world and Handke felt real grief or whatever. But that’s not what this book’s about. Books aren’t about ‘real life.’ Books are about other books.” He raised his mouth like a wind instrument and blew out bright notes.', '', '“My theory is that the problem Handke was trying to solve here, from a literary standpoint, was how do you write about something, even something real and painful—like suicide—when all of the writing that’s been done on that subject has robbed you of any originality of expression?”', '', 'What Thurston was saying seemed to Madeleine both insightful and horribly wrong. It was maybe true, what he said, but it shouldn’t have been.', '', '“‘Popular literature,’” Zipperstein quipped, proposing an essay title. “‘Or, How to Beat a Dead Horse.’”', '', 'A spasm of mirth traveled through the class. Madeleine looked over to see that Leonard was staring at her. When the class ended, he gathered up his books and left.', '', 'She started seeing Leonard around after that. She saw him crossing the green one afternoon, hatless in winter drizzle. She saw him at Mutt & Geoff’s, eating a messy Buddy Cianci sandwich. She saw him, one morning, waiting for a bus on South Main. Each time, Leonard was alone, looking forlorn and uncombed like a great big motherless boy. At the same time, he appeared somehow older than most guys at school.', '', 'It was Madeleine’s last semester of senior year, a time when she was supposed to have some fun, and she wasn’t having any. She’d never thought of herself as hard up. She preferred to think of her current boyfriendless state as salutary and head-clearing. But when she found herself wondering what it would be like to kiss a guy who chewed tobacco, she began to worry that she was fooling herself.', '', 'Looking back, Madeleine realized that her college love life had fallen short of expectations. Her freshman roommate, Jennifer Boomgaard, had rushed off to Health Services the first week of school to be fitted for a diaphragm. Unaccustomed to sharing a room with anybody, much less a stranger, Madeleine felt that Jenny was a little too quick with her intimacies. She didn’t want to be shown Jennifer’s diaphragm, which reminded her of an uncooked ravioli, and she certainly didn’t want to feel the spermicidal jelly that Jenny offered to squirt into her palm. Madeleine was shocked when Jennifer started going to parties with the diaphragm already in place, when she wore it to the Harvard-Brown game, and when she left it one morning on top of their miniature fridge. That winter, when the Rev. Desmond Tutu came to campus for an anti-apartheid rally, Madeleine asked Jennifer on their way to see the great cleric, “Did you put your diaphragm in?” They lived the next four months in an eighteen-by-fifteen room without speaking to each other.', '', 'Though Madeleine hadn’t arrived at college sexually inexperienced, her freshman learning curve resembled a flat line. Aside from one make-out session with a Uruguayan named Carlos, a sandal-wearing engineering student who in low light looked like Che Guevara, the only boy she’d fooled around with was a high school senior visiting campus for Early Action weekend. She found Tim standing in line at the Ratty, pushing his cafeteria tray along the metal track, and visibly quivering. His blue blazer was too big for him. He’d spent the entire day wandering around campus with no one speaking to him. Now he was starving and wasn’t sure if he was allowed to eat in the cafeteria or not. Tim seemed to be the only person at Brown more lost than Madeleine. She helped him negotiate the Ratty and, afterward, took him on a tour of the university. Finally, around ten-thirty that night, they ended up back in Madeleine’s dorm room. Tim had the long-lashed eyes and pretty features of an expensive Bavarian doll, a little prince or yodeling shepherd boy. His blue blazer was on the floor and Madeleine’s shirt unbuttoned when Jennifer Boomgaard came through the door. “Oh,” she said, “sorry,” and proceeded to stand there, smiling at the floor as if already relishing how this juicy bit of gossip would play along the hall. When she finally did leave, Madeleine sat up and readjusted her clothes, and Tim picked up his blazer and went back to high school.', '', 'At Christmas, when Madeleine went home for vacation, she thought the scale in her parents’ bathroom was broken. She got off to recalibrate the dial and got back on, whereupon the scale again registered the same weight. Stepping in front of the mirror, Madeleine encountered a worried chipmunk staring back.', '', '“Am I not getting asked out because I’m fat,” the chipmunk said, “or am I fat because I’m not getting asked out?”', '', '“I never got the freshman fifteen,” her sister gloated when Madeleine came down to breakfast.', '', '“But I didn’t pig out like all my friends did.” Accustomed to Alwyn’s teasing, Madeleine paid no attention, quietly slicing and eating the first of the fifty-seven grapefruits she subsisted on until New Year’s.', '', 'Dieting fooled you into thinking you could control your life. By January, Madeleine was down five pounds, and by the time squash season ended she was back in great shape, and still she didn’t meet anyone she liked. The boys at college seemed either incredibly immature or prematurely middle-aged, bearded like therapists, warming brandy snifters over candles while listening to Coltrane’s A Love Supreme. It wasn’t until her junior year that Madeleine had a serious boyfriend. Billy Bainbridge was the son of Dorothy Bainbridge, whose uncle owned a third of the newspapers in the United States. Billy had flushed cheeks, blond curls, and a scar on his right temple that made him even more adorable than he already was. He was soft-spoken and nice-smelling, like Ivory soap. Naked, his body was nearly hairless.', '', 'Billy didn’t like to talk about his family. Madeleine took this as a sign of good breeding. Billy was a legacy at Brown and sometimes worried that he wouldn’t have gotten in on his own. Sex with Billy was cozy, it was snuggly, it was perfectly fine. He wanted to be a filmmaker. The one film he made for Advanced Filmmaking, however, was a violent, unbroken twelve minutes of Billy throwing fecal-looking brownie mix at the camera. Madeleine began to wonder if there was a reason he never talked about his family.', '', 'One thing he did talk about, however, with increasing intensity, was circumcision. Billy had read an article in an alternative health magazine that argued against the practice, and it made a big impression on him.', '', '“If you think about it, it’s a pretty weird thing to do to a baby,” he said. “Cut off part of its dick? What’s so different about a tribe in, like, Papua New Guinea putting bones through their noses and cutting off a baby’s foreskin? A bone through the nose is a lot less invasive.” Madeleine listened, trying to look sympathetic, and hoped Billy would drop the subject. But as the weeks passed he kept returning to it.', '', '“The doctors just do it automatically in this country,” he said.', '', '“They didn’t ask my parents. It’s not like I’m Jewish or anything.” He derided justifications on the basis of health or hygiene. “Maybe that made sense three thousand years ago, out in the desert, when you couldn’t take a shower. But now?”', '', 'One night, as they were lying in bed, naked, Madeleine noticed Billy examining his penis, stretching it.', '', '“What are you doing?” she asked.', '', '“I’m looking for the scar,” he said somberly.', '', 'He interrogated his European friends, Henrik the Intact, Olivier the Foreskinned, asking,', '', '“But does it feel supersensitive?” Billy was convinced that he’d been deprived of sensation. Madeleine tried not to take this personally. Plus there were other problems with their relationship by then. Billy had a habit of staring deeply into Madeleine’s eyes in a way that was somehow controlling. His roommate situation was odd. He lived off campus with an attractive, muscular girl named Kyle who was sleeping with at least three people, including Fatima Shirazi, a niece of the shah of Iran. On the wall of his living room Billy had painted the words Kill the Father. Killing the father was what, in Billy’s opinion, college was all about.', '', '“Who’s your father?” he asked Madeleine. “Is it Virginia Woolf? Is it Sontag?”', '', '“In my case,” Madeleine said, “my father really is my father.”', '', '“Then you have to kill him.”', '', '“Who’s your father?”', '', '“Godard,” he said.', '', 'Billy talked about renting a house in Guanajuato with Madeleine over the summer. He said she could write a novel while he made a film. His faith in her, in her writing (even though she hardly wrote any fiction), made Madeleine feel so good that she started going along with the idea. And then one day she came up onto Billy’s front porch and was about to rap on his window when something told her to look in the window instead. In the storm-tossed bed, Billy lay curled, John Lennon–style, against the spread-eagled Kyle. Both were naked. A second later, in a puff of smoke, Fatima materialized, also naked, shaking baby powder over her gleaming Persian skin. She smiled at her bedmates, her teeth seed-like in purple, royal gums.', '', 'Maddy’s next boyfriend wasn’t strictly her fault. She would never have met Dabney Carlisle if she hadn’t taken an acting class, and she would never have taken an acting class if it hadn’t been for her mother. As a young woman, Phyllida had wanted to be an actress. Her parents had been opposed, however.', '', '“Acting wasn’t what people in our family, especially the ladies, did,” was the way Phyllida put it. Every so often, in reflective moods, she told her daughters the story of her one great disobedience. After graduating from college, Phyllida had “run away” to Hollywood. Without telling her parents, she’d flown out to Los Angeles, staying with a friend from Smith. She’d found a job as a secretary in an insurance company. She and the friend, a girl named Sally Peyton, moved into a bungalow in Santa Monica. In six months Phyllida had three auditions, one screen test, and “loads of invitations.” She’d once seen Jackie Gleason carrying a chihuahua into a restaurant. She’d developed a lustrous suntan she described as “Egyptian.” Whenever Phyllida spoke about this period in her life, it seemed as if she was talking about another person. As for Alton, he became quiet, fully aware that Phyllida’s loss had been his gain. It was on the train back to New York, the next Christmas, that she’d met the straight-backed lieutenant colonel, recently returned from Berlin. Phyllida never went back to L.A. She got married instead. “And had you two,” she told her daughters.', '', 'Phyllida’s inability to realize her dreams had given Madeleine her own. Her mother’s life was the great counterexample. It represented the injustice Madeleine’s life would rectify. To come of age simultaneously with a great social movement, to grow up in the age of Betty Friedan and ERA marches and Bella Abzug’s indomitable hats, to define your identity when it was being redefined, this was a freedom as great as any of the American freedoms Madeleine had read about in school. She could remember the night, in 1973, when her family gathered before the television in the den to watch the tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs. How she, Alwyn, and Phyllida had rooted for Billie Jean, while Alton had pulled for Bobby Riggs. How, as King ran Riggs back and forth across the court, outserving him, hitting winners he was too slow to return, Alton began to grumble.', '', '“It’s not a fair fight! Riggs is too old.', '', 'If they want a real test, she should play Smith or Newcombe.”', '', 'But it didn’t matter what Alton said.', '', 'It didn’t matter that Bobby Riggs was fifty-five and King twenty-nine, or that Riggs hadn’t been an especially great player even in his prime. What mattered was that this tennis match was on national television, during prime time, billed for weeks as “The Battle of the Sexes,” and that the woman was winning. If any single moment defined Madeleine’s generation of girls, dramatized their aspirations, put into clear focus what they expected from themselves and from life, it was those two hours and fifteen minutes when the country watched a man in white shorts get thrashed by a woman, pummeled repeatedly until all he could do, after match point, was to jump feebly over the net. And even that was telling: you were supposed to jump the net when you won, not lost. So how male was that, to act like a winner when you’d just been creamed?', '', 'At the first meeting of Acting Workshop, Professor Churchill, a bald bullfrog of a man, asked the students to say something about themselves. Half the people in the class were theater majors, serious about acting or directing. Madeleine mumbled something about loving Shakespeare and Eugene O’Neill.', '', 'Dabney Carlisle stood up and said, “I’ve done a little modeling work, down in New York. My agent suggested I should take some acting lessons. So here I am.”', '', 'The modeling he’d done consisted of a single magazine ad, showing a group of Leni Riefenstahl–ish athletes in boxer briefs, standing in a receding line on a beach whose black volcanic sand steamed around their marble feet. Madeleine didn’t see the photograph until she and Dabney were already going out, when Dabney gingerly took it out of the bartending manual where he kept it safely pressed. She was inclined to make fun of it but something reverential in Dabney’s expression stopped her. And so she asked where the beach had been (Montauk) and why it was so black (it wasn’t) and how much he’d gotten paid (“four figures”) and what the other guys were like (“total a-holes”) and if he was wearing the underpants right now. It was sometimes difficult, with boys, to take an interest in the things that interested them. But with Dabney she wished it had been curling, she longed for it to be the model UN, anything but male modeling. This, anyway, was the authentic emotion she now identified herself as having felt. At the time—Dabney cautioned her against touching the ad before he got it laminated—Madeleine had rehearsed in her mind the standard arguments: that though objectification was de facto bad, the emergence of the idealized male form in the mass media scored a point for equality; that if men started getting objectified and started worrying about their looks and their bodies, they might begin to understand the burden women had been living with since forever, and might therefore be sensitized to these issues of the body. She even went so far as to admire Dabney for his courage in allowing himself to be photographed in snug little gray underpants.', '', 'Looking the way Madeleine and Dabney did, it was inevitable that they would be cast as romantic leads in the scenes the workshop performed. Madeleine was Rosalind to Dabney’s wooden Orlando, Maggie to his brick-like Brick in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. To rehearse the first time, they met at Dabney’s fraternity house. Merely stepping through the front door reinforced Madeleine’s aversion to places like Sigma Chi. It was around ten on a Sunday morning. The vestiges of the previous evening’s “Hawaiian Night” were still there to see—the lei hanging from the antlers of the moose head on the wall, the plastic “grass” skirt trampled on the beer-sodden floor, a skirt that, should Madeleine succumb to the outrageous good looks of Dabney Carlisle, she might, at a minimum, have to watch some drunken slut hula in to the baying of the brothers, or, at a maximum (for mai tais made you do crazy things), might even don herself, up in Dabney’s room, for his pleasure alone. On the low-slung couch two Sigma Chi members were watching TV. At Madeleine’s appearance, they stirred, rising out of the gloom like openmouthed carp. She hurried to the back stairs, thinking the things she always thought when it came to frats and frat guys: that their appeal stemmed from a primitive need for protection (one thought of Neanderthal clans banding together against other Neanderthal clans); that the hazing the pledges underwent (being stripped and blindfolded and left in the lobby of the Biltmore Hotel with bus fare taped to their genitals) enacted the very fears of male rape and emasculation that membership in the fraternity promised protection against; that any guy who longed to join a frat suffered from insecurities that poisoned his relationships with women; that there was something seriously wrong with homophobic guys who centered their lives around a homoerotic bond; that the stately mansions maintained by generations of dues-paying fraternity members were in reality sites for date rape and problem drinking; that frats always smelled bad; that you didn’t ever want to shower in one; that only freshman girls were stupid enough to go to frat parties; that Kelly Traub had slept with a Sigma Delt guy who kept saying,', '', '“Now you see it, now you don’t, now you see it, now you don’t”; that such a thing wasn’t going to happen to her, to Madeleine, ever.', '', 'What she hadn’t expected when it came to a fraternity was a sunny-haired silent type like Dabney, learning his lines in a folding chair, in parachute pants, shoeless. Looking back on their relationship, Madeleine figured she’d had no choice. Dabney and she had been selected for each other in a Royal Wedding kind of way. She was Prince Charles to his Princess Di. She knew he couldn’t act. Dabney had the artistic soul of a third-string tight end. In life Dabney moved and said little. Onstage he moved not at all but had to say a lot. His best dramatic moments came when the strain on his face from remembering his lines resembled the emotion he was trying to simulate.', '', 'Acting opposite Dabney made Madeleine more stiff and nervous than she already was. She wanted to do scenes with the talented kids in the workshop. She suggested interesting bits from The Vietnamization of New Jersey and Mamet’s Sexual Perversity in Chicago, but got no takers. Nobody wanted to lower his or her average by acting with her.', '', 'Dabney didn’t let it bother him. “Bunch of little shits in that class,” he said. “They’ll never get any print work, much less movies.”', '', 'He was more laconic than she liked her boyfriends to be. He had the wit of a store mannequin. But Dabney’s physical perfection pushed these realities out of her mind. She’d never been in a relationship where she wasn’t the more attractive partner. It was slightly intimidating. But she could handle it. At three a.m., while Dabney lay sleeping beside her, Madeleine found she was up to the task of inventorying each abdominal cord, every hard lump of muscle. She enjoyed applying calipers to Dabney’s waist to measure his body fat. Underwear modeling was all about the abs, Dabney said, and the abs were all about sit-ups and diet. The pleasure Madeleine got from looking at Dabney was reminiscent of the pleasure she’d gotten as a girl from looking at sleek hunting dogs. Underneath this pleasure, like the coals that fed it, was a fierce need to enfold Dabney and siphon off his strength and beauty. It was all very primitive and evolutionary and felt fantastic. The problem was that she hadn’t been able to allow herself to enjoy Dabney or even to exploit him a little, but had had to go and be a total girl about it and convince herself that she was in love with him. Madeleine required emotion, apparently. She disapproved of the idea of meaningless, extremely satisfying sex.', '', 'And so she began to tell herself that Dabney’s acting was “restrained” or “economical.” She appreciated that Dabney was “secure about himself” and “didn’t need to prove anything” and wasn’t a “showoff.” Instead of worrying that he was dull, Madeleine decided he was gentle. Instead of thinking he was poorly read, she called him intuitive. She exaggerated Dabney’s mental abilities in order not to feel shallow for wanting his body. To this end she helped Dabney write—O.K., she wrote—English and anthro papers for him and, when he got A’s, felt confirmed of his intelligence. She sent him off to modeling auditions in New York with good-luck kisses and listened to him complain bitterly about the “faggots” who hadn’t hired his services. It turned out that Dabney wasn’t so beautiful. Among the truly beautiful he was only so-so. He couldn’t even smile right.', '', 'At the end of the semester, the acting students met separately with the professor for a critical review. Churchill welcomed Madeleine with a wolfish yellow grin, then sat back jowly and deliberate in his chair.', '', '“I’ve enjoyed having you in the class, Madeleine,” he said. “But you can’t act.”', '', '“Don’t hold back,” Madeleine said, chastened but laughing. “Give it to me straight.”', '', '“You have a good feel for language, for Shakespeare especially. But your voice is reedy and you look worried onstage. Your forehead has a perpetual crease. A vocal coach could go a long way toward helping your instrument. But I worry about your worrying. You’ve got it right now. The crease.”', '', '“It’s called thinking.”', '', '“Which is fine.', '', 'If you’re playing Eleanor Roosevelt. Or Golda Meir. But those parts don’t come around very often.”', '', 'Churchill, steepling his fingers, continued, “I’d be more diplomatic if I thought this meant a lot to you. But I get the feeling you don’t want to be a professional actress, do you?”', '', '“No,” Madeleine said.', '', '“Good. You’re lovely. You’re bright. The world is your oyster. Go with my blessings.”', '', 'When Dabney returned from his review with Churchill, he looked even more self-contented than usual.', '', '“So?” Madeleine asked. “How did it go?”', '', '“He says I’m perfect for soaps.”', '', '“Soap commercials?”', '', 'Dabney looked peeved. “Days of Our Lives. General Hospital. Ever heard of those?”', '', '“Did he mean that as a compliment?”', '', '“How else could he mean it? Soap actors have it made! They work every day, make great money, and never have to travel. I’ve been wasting my time trying to get all this advertising work. Screw that. I’m going to tell my agent to start lining up some auditions for soaps.”', '', 'Madeleine was silent at this news. She’d assumed Dabney’s enthusiasm for modeling was temporary, a tuition-earning scheme. Now she realized he was in earnest. She was, in fact, dating a model.', '', '“What are you thinking?” Dabney asked her.', '', '“Nothing.”', '', '“Tell me.”', '', '“Just that—I don’t know—but I doubt Prof. Churchill has that high of an opinion of the acting on Days of Our Lives.”', '', '“What did he tell us the first class? He said he was giving a workshop in acting. For people who wanted to work in the theater.”', '', '“In the theater doesn’t mean …”', '', '“What did he tellyou? Did he say you were going to be a movie star?”', '', '“He told me I couldn’t act,” Madeleine said.', '', '“He did, huh?” Dabney put his hands in his pockets, leaning back on his heels as if relieved not to have to deliver this verdict himself. “Is that why you’re so pissed off? And have to tear down my crit?”', '', '“I’m not tearing down your crit. I’m just not sure you got Churchill’s meaning, exactly.”', '', 'Dabney let out a bitter laugh. “I wouldn’t get it right, would I? I’m too dumb. I’m just some dumb jock you have to write English papers for.”', '', '“I don’t know. You seem to have a pretty good grasp of sarcasm.”', '', '“Man, am I ever lucky,” Dabney said.', '', '“What would I do if you weren’t around?', '', 'You have to catch all the subtleties for me, don’t you? You and your flair for catching subtleties. It must be nice to be rich and sit around all day catching subtleties.', '', 'What do you know about needing to make a living?', '', 'It’s fine for you to make fun of my ad. You didn’t get into college on a football scholarship. And now you have to come in here and run me down.', '', 'You know what? This is bullshit. This is total bullshit. I’m sick of your condescension and your superiority complex. And Churchill’s right. You can’t act.”', '', 'In the end Madeleine had to admit that Dabney was far more fluent than she’d ever expected. He was capable of portraying a range of emotions, too, anger, disgust, wounded pride, and of simulating others, including affection, passion, and love. He had a great career in the soaps ahead of him.', '', '', '', 'Madeleine and Dabney had broken up in May, right before summer, and there was no better time than summer to forget about somebody. She’d gone straight down to Prettybrook the day she finished her last exam. For once she was glad to have such sociable parents. With all the cocktail parties and convivial dinners on Wilson Lane there was little time to dwell on herself. In July, she got an internship at a nonprofit poetry organization on the Upper East Side and began riding the train into the city. Madeleine’s job was to oversee submissions for the annual New Voices award, which involved making sure that the submissions were complete before sending them off to the judge (Howard Nemerov, that year). Madeleine wasn’t particularly technical, but because everyone else in the office was even less so, she ended up being the go-to person whenever the copier or the dot-matrix printer malfunctioned. Her coworker Brenda would come up to Madeleine’s desk at least once a week and ask in a babyish voice,', '', '“Can you help me? The printer’s not being nice.” The only part of the day Madeleine enjoyed was her lunch hour, when she got to walk around the muggy, stinking, thrilling streets, eat quiche in a French bistro as narrow as a bowling alley, and stare at the styles women her age or a little older were wearing. When the one straight guy at the nonprofit asked her to have a drink after work,', '', 'Madeleine cooly answered, “Sorry, I can’t,” trying not to feel bad about hurting his feelings, trying to think about her own feelings for a change.', '', 'She arrived back at college for her senior year, then, intent on being studious, career-oriented, and aggressively celibate. Casting a wide net, Madeleine sent away for applications to Yale grad school (English Language and Literature), an organization for teaching English in China, and an advertising internship at Foote, Cone & Belding, in Chicago. She studied for the GRE using a sample booklet. The verbal section was easy. The math required brushing up on her high school algebra. The logic problems, however, were a defeat to the spirit. “At the annual dancers’ ball a number of dancers performed their favorite dance with their favorite partners. Alan danced the tango, while Becky watched the waltz. James and Charlotte were fantastic together. Keith was magnificent during his foxtrot and Simon excelled at the rumba. Jessica danced with Alan. But Laura did not dance with Simon. Can you determine who danced with whom and which dance they each enjoyed?” Logic wasn’t something Madeleine had been expressly taught. It seemed unfair to be asked about it. She did as the book suggested, diagramming the problems, placing Alan, Becky, James, Charlotte, Keith, Simon, Jessica, and Laura on the dance floor of her scrap paper, and pairing them according to the instructions. But their complicated transit wasn’t a subject Madeleine’s mind naturally followed. She wanted to know why James and Charlotte were fantastic together, and if Jessica and Alan were going out, and why Laura wouldn’t dance with Simon, and if Becky was upset, watching.', '', 'One afternoon, on the bulletin board outside Hillel House, Madeleine noticed a flyer announcing the Melvin and Hetty Greenberg Fellowship for summer study at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and she applied for that. Using contacts of Alton’s in the publishing world, she put on a business suit and went down to New York for an informational interview with an editor at Simon and Schuster. The editor, Terry Wirth, had once been a bright, idealistic English major just like Madeleine, but she found him that afternoon, in his tiny, manuscript-piled office looking onto the gloomy canyon of Sixth Avenue, a middle-aged father of two with a salary far below the median of his former classmates and a nasty, hour-and-fifteen-minute commute to his split-level in Montclair, New Jersey. On the prospects of a book he was publishing that month, the memoir of a migrant farmer,', '', 'Wirth said, “Now’s the calm before the calm.” He gave Madeleine a stack of manuscripts from the slush pile to critique, offering to pay her fifty bucks a pop.', '', 'Instead of reading the manuscripts, Madeleine took the subway down to the East Village. After buying a bag of pignoli cookies at De Robertis, she plunged into a hair salon, where, on a whim, she allowed a butch woman with a short, rat-tailed haircut to go to work on her.', '', '“Cut it close on the sides, higher on top,” Madeleine said.', '', '“You sure?” the woman said.', '', '“I’m sure,” Madeleine answered. To show her resolve, she took off her glasses. Forty-five minutes later, she put her glasses back on, horror-struck and elated at the transformation. Her head was really quite enormous. She had never fathomed its true size. She looked like Annie Lennox, or David Bowie. Like someone the hairdresser might be dating.', '', 'The Annie Lennox look was O.K., however. Androgyny was just the thing. Once she was back at school, Madeleine’s haircut proclaimed her serious frame of mind, and by the end of the year, when her bangs had grown out to a maddening length she didn’t know what to do with, she remained firm in her renunciations. (Her only slip-up had been the night in her bedroom with Mitchell, but nothing had happened.) Madeleine had her thesis to write. She had her future to figure out. The last thing she needed was a boy to distract her from her work and disturb her equilibrium. But then, during spring semester, she met Leonard Bankhead and her resolve went out the window.', '', 'He shaved irregularly. His Skoal had a menthol scent, cleaner, more pleasant than Madeleine expected. Whenever she looked up to find Leonard staring at her with his St. Bernard’s eyes (the eyes of a drooler, maybe, but also of a loyal brute who could dig you out of an avalanche), Madeleine couldn’t help staring back a significant moment longer.', '', 'One evening in early March, when she went to the Rockefeller Library to pick up the reserve reading for Semiotics 211, she found Leonard there as well. He was leaning against the counter, speaking animatedly to the girl on duty, who was unfortunately rather cute in a busty Bettie Page way.', '', '“Think about it, though,” Leonard was saying to the girl. “Think about it from the point of view of the fly.”', '', '“O.K., I’m a fly,” the girl said with a throaty laugh.', '', '“We move in slow motion to them. They can see the swatter coming from a million miles away. The flies are like, ‘Wake me when the swatter gets close.’”', '', 'Noticing Madeleine, the girl told Leonard, “Just a sec.”', '', 'Madeleine held out her call order slip, and the girl took it and went off into the stacks.', '', '“Picking up the Balzac?” Leonard said.', '', '“Yes.”', '', '“Balzac to the rescue.”', '', 'Normally, Madeleine would have had many things to say to this, many comments about Balzac to make. But her mind was a blank. She didn’t even remember to smile until he’d looked away.', '', 'Bettie Page came back with Madeleine’s order, sliding it toward her and immediately turning back to Leonard. He seemed different than he did in class, more exuberant, supercharged. He raised his eyebrows in a crazed, Jack Nicholson way and said,', '', '“My house fly theory is related to my theory about why time seems to go faster as you get older.”', '', '“Why’s that?” the girl asked.', '', '“It’s proportional,” Leonard explained. “When you’re five, you’ve only been alive a couple thousand days. But by the time you’re fifty, you’ve lived around twenty thousand days. So a day when you’re five seems longer because it’s a greater percentage of the whole.”', '', '“Yeah, sure,” the girl teased, “that follows.”', '', 'But Madeleine had understood. “That makes sense,” she said. “I always wondered why that was.”', '', '“It’s just a theory,” Leonard said.', '', 'Bettie Page tapped Leonard’s hand to get his attention.', '', '“Flies aren’t always so fast,” she said.', '', '“I’ve caught flies in my bare hands before.”', '', '“Especially in winter,” Leonard said.', '', '“That’s probably the kind of fly I’d be. One of those knucklehead winter flies.”', '', 'There was no good excuse for Madeleine to hang around the reserve reading room, and so she put the Balzac into her bag and headed out.', '', 'She began to dress differently on the days she had semiotics. She took out her diamond studs, leaving her ears bare. She stood in front of the mirror wondering if her Annie Hall glasses might possibly project a New Wave look. She decided not and wore her contacts. She unearthed a pair of Beatle boots she’d bought at a church basement sale in Vinalhaven. She put up her collar, and wore more black.', '', 'In Week Four, Zipperstein assigned Umberto Eco’s The Role of the Reader. It hadn’t done much for Madeleine. She wasn’t all that interested, as a reader, in the reader. She was still partial to that increasingly eclipsed entity: the writer. Madeleine had a feeling that most semiotic theorists had been unpopular as children, often bullied or overlooked, and so had directed their lingering rage onto literature. They wanted to demote the author. They wanted a book, that hard-won, transcendent thing, to be a text, contingent, indeterminate, and open for suggestions. They wanted the reader to be the main thing. Because they were readers.', '', 'Whereas Madeleine was perfectly happy with the idea of genius. She wanted a book to take her places she couldn’t get to herself. She thought a writer should work harder writing a book than she did reading it. When it came to letters and literature, Madeleine championed a virtue that had fallen out of esteem: namely, clarity. The week after they read Eco, they read portions of Derrida’s Writing and Difference. The week after that, they read Jonathan Culler’s On Deconstruction, and Madeleine came to class ready to contribute to the discussion for the first time. Before she could do so, however, Thurston beat her to it.', '', '“The Culler was passable at best,” Thurston said.', '', '“What didn’t you like about it?” the professor asked him.', '', 'Thurston had his knee up against the edge of the seminar table. He pushed his chair up on its back legs, scrunching up his face. “It’s readable and everything,” he said. “And well argued and all that. But it’s just a question of whether you can use a discredited discourse—like, say, reason—to explicate something as paradigmatically revolutionary as deconstruction.”', '', 'Madeleine searched along the table for mutual eye-rolling but the other students seemed eager to hear what Thurston had to say.', '', '“Care to elaborate?” Zipperstein said.', '', '“Well, what I mean is, first off, reason is just a discourse like any other, right? It’s only been imbued with a sense of absolute truth because it’s the privileged discourse of the West. What Derrida’s saying is that you have to use reason because, you know, reason is all there is. But at the same time you have to be aware that language is by its very nature unreasonable. You have to reason yourself out of reasonableness.” He pulled up the sleeve of his T-shirt and scratched his bony shoulder. “Culler, on the other hand, is still operating in the old mode. Mono as opposed to stereo. So from that point of view, I found the book, yeah, a little bit disappointing.”', '', 'A silence ensued. And deepened.', '', '“I don’t know,” Madeleine said, glancing at Leonard for support.', '', '“Maybe it’s just me, but wasn’t it a relief to read a logical argument for once? Culler boils down everything Eco and Derrida are saying into a digestible form.”', '', 'Thurston turned his head slowly to gaze across the seminar table at her.', '', '“I’m not saying it’s bad,” he said. “It’s fine. But Culler’s work is of a different order than Derrida. Every genius needs an explainer. That’s what Culler is for Derrida.”', '', 'Madeleine shrugged this off. “I got a lot better idea of what deconstruction is from reading Culler than from reading Derrida.”', '', 'Thurston took pains to give her point of view full consideration. “It’s the nature of a simplification to be simple,” he said.', '', 'Class ended shortly after that, leaving Madeleine fuming. As she was coming out of Sayles Hall, she saw Leonard standing on the steps, holding a Coke can. She went right up to him and said, “Thanks for the help.”', '', '“Excuse me?”', '', '“I thought you were on my side. Why didn’t you say anything in class?”', '', '“First Law of Thermodynamics,” Leonard said. “Conservation of energy.”', '', '“Didn’t you agree with me?”', '', '“I did and I didn’t,” Leonard said.', '', '“You didn’t like the Culler?”', '', '“The Culler’s good. But Derrida’s a heavyweight. You can’t just write him off.”', '', 'Madeleine looked dubious, but Derrida wasn’t who she was mad at. “Considering how Thurston’s always going on about how much he worships language, you’d think he wouldn’t parrot so much jargon. He used the word phallus three times today.”', '', 'Leonard smiled. “Figures if he says it it’ll be like having one.”', '', '“He drives me crazy.”', '', '“You want to get some coffee?”', '', '“And fascist. That’s another of his favorites. You know the dry cleaners on Thayer Street? He called them fascist.”', '', '“Must have gone extra heavy on the starch.”', '', '“Yes,” Madeleine said.', '', '“Yes, what?”', '', '“You just invited me for coffee.”', '', '“I did?” Leonard said. “Yes, I did. O.K. Let’s go get coffee.”', '', 'Leonard didn’t want to go to the Blue Room. He said he didn’t like to be around college students. They headed through Wayland Arch up to Hope Street, in the direction of Fox Point.', '', 'As they walked, Leonard spat into his Coke can every so often.', '', '“Pardon my disgusting habit,” he said.', '', 'Madeleine wrinkled up her nose. “Are you going to keep doing that?”', '', '“No,” Leonard said. “I don’t even know why I do it. It’s just something I picked up from my rodeo days.”', '', 'At the next trash can they came to, he tossed the Coke and spat out his wad of tobacco.', '', 'Within a few blocks pretty campus plantings of tulip and daffodil gave way to treeless streets lined by working-class houses painted in cheerful hues. They passed a Portuguese bakery and a Portuguese fish store selling sardines and cuttlefish. The kids here had no yards to play in but seemed happy enough, wheeling back and forth along the blank sidewalks. Nearer the highway, there were a few warehouses and, on the corner of Wickenden, a local diner.', '', 'Leonard wanted to sit at the counter. “I need to be close to the pies,” he said. “I need to see which one is talking to me.”', '', 'As Madeleine took a stool next to him, Leonard stared at the dessert case.', '', '“Do you remember when they used to serve slices of cheese with apple pie?” he asked.', '', '“Vaguely,” Madeleine said.', '', '“They don’t seem to do that anymore. You and I are probably the only two people in this place who remember it.”', '', '“Actually, I don’t remember it,” Madeleine said.', '', '“You don’t? Never had a little slice of Wisconsin cheddar with your apple pie? I’m sorry to hear that.”', '', '“Maybe they’ll put a slice of cheese on a piece if you ask them.”', '', '“I didn’t say I liked it. I’m just mourning its passage.”', '', 'The conversation lapsed. And suddenly, to her surprise, Madeleine was flooded with panic. She felt the silence like a judgment against her. At the same time, her anxiety about the silence made it even harder to speak.', '', 'Though it didn’t feel nice to be so nervous, it did feel nice, in a way. It had been a while since Madeleine had been that way around a guy.', '', 'The waitress was down at the end of the counter talking to another customer.', '', '“So why are you taking Zipperstein’s class?” she asked.', '', '“Philosophical interest,” Leonard said. “Literally. Philosophy’s all about theory of language right now. It’s all linguistics. So I figured I’d check it out.”', '', '“Aren’t you a biology major, too?”', '', '“That’s what I really am,” Leonard said. “The philosophy’s just a sideline.”', '', 'Madeleine realized that she’d never dated a science major.', '', '“Do you want to be a doctor?”', '', '“Right now all I want to do is get the waitress’s attention.”', '', 'Leonard waved his arm a few times to no avail. Suddenly he said, “Is it hot in here?”', '', 'Without waiting for an answer, he reached into the back pocket of his jeans and pulled out a blue bandanna, which he proceeded to put over his head, tying it in back and making a number of small, precise adjustments until he was satisfied. Madeleine watched this with a slight feeling of disappointment. She associated bandannas with hacky sack, the Grateful Dead, and alfalfa sprouts, all of which she could do without. Still, she was impressed with Leonard’s sheer size on the stool next to her. His largeness, coupled with the softness—the delicacy, almost—of his voice, gave Madeleine a strange fairytale feeling, as if she were a princess sitting beside a gentle giant.', '', '“The thing is, though,” Leonard said, still staring in the waitress’s direction,', '', '“I didn’t get interested in philosophy because of linguistics. I got interested for the eternal verities. To learn how to die, et cetera. Now it’s more like, ‘What do we mean when we say we die?’', '', '‘What do we mean we mean when we say we die?’”', '', 'Finally, the waitress came over. Madeleine ordered the cottage cheese plate and coffee. Leonard ordered apple pie and coffee. When the waitress left, he spun his stool rightward, so that their knees briefly touched.', '', '“How very female of you,” he said.', '', '“Sorry?”', '', '“Cottage cheese.”', '', '“I like cottage cheese.”', '', '“Are you on a diet? You don’t look like someone on a diet.”', '', '“Why do you want to know?” Madeleine said.', '', 'And here, for the first time, Leonard appeared rattled. Beneath the line of the bandanna, his face colored, and he spun away, breaking eye contact. “Just curious,” he said.', '', 'In the next second, he spun back, resuming the previous conversation. “Derrida’s supposed to be a lot clearer in French,” he said. “Rumor has it his prose in French is limpid.”', '', '“Maybe I should read it in French, then.”', '', '“You know French?” Leonard said, sounding impressed.', '', '“I’m not great. I can read Flaubert.”', '', 'It was then that Madeleine made a big mistake. Things were going so well with Leonard, the mood was so promising—even the weather lending a hand because, after they finished their food and left the diner, walking back to campus, a March drizzle forced them to share Madeleine’s collapsible umbrella—that a feeling came over her like those she’d had as a girl when treated to a pastry or a dessert, a happiness so fraught by an awareness of its brevity that she took the tiniest bites, making the cream puff or éclair last as long as possible. In this same way, instead of seeing where the afternoon led, Madeleine decided to check its progress, to save some for later, and she told Leonard she had to go home and study.', '', 'They didn’t kiss goodbye. They didn’t come close to it.', '', 'Leonard, hunching under the umbrella, abruptly said “Bye” and hurried off through the rain, keeping his head down. Madeleine went back to the Narragansett. She lay down on her bed, and didn’t move for a long time.', '', 'The days dragged until the next meeting of Sem 211. Madeleine arrived early, choosing a seat at the seminar table next to Leonard’s usual spot. But when he showed up, ten minutes late, he took an available chair next to the professor. He didn’t say anything in class or glance in Madeleine’s direction even once. His face looked swollen and there was a line of blemishes running down one cheek. When the class ended, Leonard was the first one out the door.', '', 'The next week he missed class entirely.', '', 'And so Madeleine was left to contend with semiotics, and with Zipperstein and his disciples, all by herself.', '', 'By now they had moved on to Derrida’s Of Grammatology. The Derrida went like this: “In that sense, it is the Aufhebung of other writings, particularly of hieroglyphic script and of the Leibnizian characteristic that had been criticized previously through one and the same gesture.” In poetic moods, the Derrida went like this: “What writing itself, in its nonphonetic moment, betrays, is life. It menaces at once the breath, the spirit, and history as the spirit’s relationship with itself. It is their end, their finitude, their paralysis.”', '', 'Since Derrida claimed that language, by its very nature, undermined any meaning it attempted to promote, Madeleine wondered how Derrida expected her to get his meaning. Maybe he didn’t. That was why he deployed so much arcane terminology, so many loop-de-looping clauses. That was why he said what he said in sentences it took a minute to identify the subjects of. (Could “the access to pluridimensionality and to a delinearized temporality” really be a subject?)', '', 'Reading a novel after reading semiotic theory was like jogging empty-handed after jogging with hand weights. After getting out of Semiotics 211, Madeleine fled to the Rockefeller Library, down to B Level, where the stacks exuded a vivifying smell of mold, and grabbed something—anything, The House of Mirth, Daniel Deronda—to restore herself to sanity. How wonderful it was when one sentence followed logically from the sentence before! What exquisite guilt she felt, wickedly enjoying narrative! Madeleine felt safe with a nineteenth-century novel. There were going to be people in it. Something was going to happen to them in a place resembling the world.', '', 'Then, too, there were lots of weddings in Wharton and Austen. There were all kinds of irresistible gloomy men.', '', 'The next Thursday, Madeleine came to class wearing a Norwegian sweater with a snowflake design. She’d gone back to her glasses. For the second week in a row, Leonard didn’t show up. Madeleine worried that he’d dropped the class, but it was too late in the semester to do that. Zipperstein said,', '', '“Has anybody seen Mr. Bankhead? Is he sick?” Nobody knew. Thurston arrived with a girl named Cassandra Hart, both of them sniffly and heroin-pale. Taking out a black Flair pen, Thurston wrote on Cassandra’s bare shoulder,', '', '“Not Real Skin.”', '', 'Zipperstein was in a lively mood. He’d just returned from a conference in New York, dressed differently than usual. Listening to him talk about the paper he’d given at the New School, Madeleine suddenly understood. Semiotics was the form Zipperstein’s midlife crisis had taken. Becoming a semiotician allowed Zipperstein to wear a leather jacket, to fly off to Douglas Sirk retrospectives in Vancouver, and to get all the sexy waifs in his classes. Instead of leaving his wife, Zipperstein had left the English department. Instead of buying a sports car, he’d bought deconstruction.', '', 'He sat at the seminar table now and started speaking:', '', '“I hope you read the Semiotext(e) for this week. Apropos of Lyotard, and in homage to Gertrude Stein, let me suggest the following: the thing about desire is that there is no there there.”', '', 'That was it. That was Zipperstein’s prompt. He sat before them, blinking, waiting for somebody to reply. He appeared to have all the patience in the world.', '', 'Madeleine had wanted to know what semiotics was. She’d wanted to know what the fuss was about. Well, now she felt she knew.', '', 'But then, in Week Ten, for reasons that were entirely extracurricular, semiotics began making sense.', '', 'It was a Friday night in April, just past eleven, and Madeleine was in bed, reading. The assigned text for that week was Roland Barthes’ A Lover’s Discourse. For a book purportedly about love, it didn’t look very romantic. The cover was a somber chocolate brown, the title turquoise. There was no author photograph and only a sketchy bio, listing Barthes’ other works.', '', 'Madeleine had the book in her lap. With her right hand she was eating peanut butter straight from the jar. The spoon fit perfectly against the curve of her upper palate, allowing the peanut butter to dissolve creamily against her tongue.', '', 'Opening to the introduction, she began to read:', '', 'The necessity for this book is to be found in the following consideration: that the lover’s discourse is today of an extreme solitude.', '', 'Outside, the temperature, which had remained cold through March, had shot up into the fifties. The resulting thaw was alarming in its suddenness, drainpipes and gutters dripping, sidewalks puddling, streets flooded, a constant sound of water rushing downhill.', '', 'Madeleine had her windows open on the liquid darkness. She sucked the spoon and read on:', '', 'What we have been able to say below about waiting, anxiety, memory is no more than a modest supplement offered to the reader to be made free with, to be added to, subtracted from, and passed on to others: around the figure, the players pass the handkerchief which sometimes, by a final parenthesis, is held a second longer before handing it on. (Ideally, the book would be a cooperative: “To the United Readers and Lovers.”)', '', 'It wasn’t only that this writing seemed beautiful to Madeleine. It wasn’t only that these opening sentences of Barthes’ made immediate sense. It wasn’t only the relief at recognizing that here, finally, was a book she might write her final paper on. What made Madeleine sit up in bed was something closer to the reason she read books in the first place and had always loved them. Here was a sign that she wasn’t alone. Here was an articulation of what she had been so far mutely feeling. In bed on a Friday night, wearing sweatpants, her hair tied back, her glasses smudged, and eating peanut butter from the jar, Madeleine was in a state of extreme solitude.', '', 'It had to do with Leonard. With how she felt about him and how she couldn’t tell anyone. With how much she liked him and how little she knew about him. With how desperately she wanted to see him and how hard it was to do so.', '', 'In recent days, from her solitude, Madeleine had sent out feelers. She talked about Semiotics 211 with her roommates, mentioning Thurston, Cassandra, and Leonard. It turned out that Abby knew Leonard from her freshman year.', '', '“What was he like?” Madeleine asked.', '', '“Sort of intense. Really smart, but intense. He used to call me all the time. Like every day.”', '', '“Did he like you?”', '', '“No, he just wanted to talk. He’d keep me on the phone for an hour.”', '', '“What did you guys talk about?”', '', '“Everything! His relationship. My relationship. His parents, my parents. Jimmy Carter getting attacked by that swamp rabbit, which he was obsessed about. He’d go on and on.”', '', '“Who was he going out with?”', '', '“Some girl named Mindy. But then they broke up. That’s when he really started calling me. He’d call like six times a day. He was always going on about how good Mindy smelled. She had this smell that was supposedly perfectly compatible to Leonard, chemically. He was worried no girl would ever smell right to him again. I told him it was probably her moisturizer. He said no, it was her skin. It was chemically perfect. That’s what he’s like.” She paused and gave Madeleine a searching look. “Why are you asking? Do you like him?”', '', '“I just know him from class,” Madeleine said.', '', '“Do you want me to invite him for dinner?”', '', '“I didn’t say that.”', '', '“I’ll invite him to dinner,” Abby said.', '', 'The dinner had been on Tuesday night, three days ago. Leonard had come politely bearing a gift, a set of dish towels. He’d dressed up, wearing a white shirt with a skinny necktie, his long hair gathered in a masculine ponytail like a Scottish warrior. He was touchingly sincere, saying hello to Abby, handing her the wrapped gift and thanking her for the invitation.', '', 'Madeleine tried not to seem overeager. At dinner, she paid attention to Brian Weeger, whose breath had a dog-food smell. A couple of times, when she looked over at Leonard, he stared back, fixedly, appearing almost upset. Later, when Madeleine was in the kitchen, rinsing dishes, Leonard came in. She turned to find him inspecting a bump on the wall.', '', '“This must be an old gas main,” he said.', '', 'Madeleine looked at the bump, which had been painted over many times.', '', '“They used to have gas lamps in these old places,” Leonard went on.', '', '“They probably used to pump the gas up from the basement. If anybody’s pilot blew out, on any floor, you’d have a leak. Gas didn’t have an odor back then, either. They didn’t start adding methyl mercaptan until later.”', '', '“Good to know,” Madeleine said.', '', '“This place must have been a powder keg.” Leonard tapped the jutting object with his fingernail, turned, and looked Madeleine meaningfully in the face.', '', '“I haven’t been going to class,” he said.', '', '“I know.”', '', 'Leonard’s head was way up above her, but then he bent down, in a peaceful, leaf-eater motion, and said, “I haven’t been feeling well.”', '', '“Were you sick?”', '', '“I’m better now.”', '', 'In the living room Olivia called out, “Who wants some Delamain? It’s yummy!”', '', '“I want some,” Brian Weeger said. “That stuff’s killer.”', '', 'Leonard said, “Were the dish towels all right?”', '', '“What?”', '', '“The dish towels. I bought you some dish towels.”', '', '“Oh, they’re great,” Madeleine said. “They’re perfect. We’ll use them! Thank you.”', '', '“I would have brought wine, or scotch, but that’s the kind of thing my father would do.”', '', '“You don’t want to do anything your father would do?”', '', 'Leonard’s face and voice remained solemn as he replied, “My father is a depressive who self-medicates with alcohol. My mother is more or less the same.”', '', '“Where do they live?”', '', '“They’re divorced. My mother still lives in Portland, where I’m from. My dad’s in Europe. He lives in Antwerp. Last time I heard.”', '', 'This interchange was encouraging, in a way. Leonard was sharing personal information. On the other hand, the information indicated that he had a troubled relationship with his parents, who were themselves troubled, and Madeleine made a point of going out only with guys who liked their parents.', '', '“What does your father do?” Leonard asked.', '', 'Caught off guard, Madeleine hesitated. “He used to work at a college,” she said. “He’s retired.”', '', '“What was he? Professor?”', '', '“He was the president.”', '', 'Leonard’s face twitched. “Oh.”', '', '“It’s just a small college. In New Jersey. It’s called Baxter.”', '', 'Abby came in to get some glasses. Leonard helped her get them off the top shelf. When she was gone, he turned back to Madeleine and said, as if in pain, “There’s a Fellini film playing at the Cable Car this weekend. Amarcord.”', '', 'Madeleine gazed encouragingly up at him. There were all kinds of outmoded, novelistic words to describe how she was feeling, words like aflutter. But she had her rules. One rule was that the guy had to ask her out, not the other way around.', '', '“I think it’s playing on Saturday,” Leonard said.', '', '“This Saturday?”', '', '“Do you like Fellini?”', '', 'To reply to this question did not, in Madeleine’s view, compromise her rule.', '', '“You want to know something embarrassing?” she said.', '', '“I’ve never seen a Fellini film.”', '', '“You should see one,” Leonard said.', '', '“I’ll call you.”', '', '“All right.”', '', '“Do I have your number? Oh, right, I have it. It’s the same as Abby’s number.”', '', '“Do you want me to write it down?” Madeleine asked.', '', '“No,” Leonard said.', '', '“I have it.”', '', 'And he rose, brontosaurus-like, to his place among the treetops.', '', 'For the rest of the week, Madeleine stayed in every night, waiting for Leonard to call. When she came back from classes in the afternoon she interrogated her roommates to find out if he had called while she was out.', '', '“Some guy called yesterday,” Olivia said, on Thursday. “When I was in the shower.”', '', '“Why didn’t you tell me?”', '', '“Sorry, I forgot.”', '', '“Who was it?”', '', '“He didn’t say.”', '', '“Did it sound like Leonard?”', '', '“I didn’t notice.

He said he’d call back later.”', '', 'And so now it was Friday night—Friday night!—and Madeleine had declined to go out with Abby and Olivia in order to stay in and wait by the phone.

Madeleine’s bedroom faced the State Capitol dome, brightly lit against the dark sky. The heat, which they couldn’t control, was still on, the radiator wastefully knocking and hissing.', '', 'The more she thought about it, the more Madeleine understood that extreme solitude didn’t just describe the way she was feeling about Leonard. It explained how she’d always felt when she was in love. It explained what love was like and, just maybe, what was wrong with it.', '', 'The telephone rang.', '', 'Madeleine sat up in bed. She dog-eared the page she was reading. She waited as long as she could (three rings) before answering.', '', '“Hello?”', '', '“Maddy?”', '', 'It was Alton, calling from Prettybrook.', '', '“Oh.

Option two: We come up the morning of the ceremony, have breakfast with you, and then leave after the ceremony. Both proposals are acceptable to us. It’s your choice. But let me explain the pros and cons of each scenario.”', '', 'Madeleine was about to answer when Phyllida spoke up on another extension.', '', '“Hi, dear.

It’ll always be your room.”', '', '“What about my wallpaper?”', '', '“It’s old. It’s peeling.”', '', '“You can’t change my wallpaper!”', '', '“Oh, all right. I’ll leave the wallpaper alone. But the carpet—”', '', '“Excuse me,” Alton said in a peremptory tone. “This call is about graduation. Phyl, you’re hijacking my agenda. You two sort out the redecorating some other time. Now, Maddy, let me go over the pros and cons. When your cousin graduated from Williams, we all had dinner after the ceremony. And, if you’ll remember, Doats complained the whole time that he was missing all the parties—and he left halfway through the meal. Now, your mother and I are willing to stay the night—or two nights—if we’re going to see you.

He’s freaking out about graduation plans already.”', '', '“I was just having a little freak-out myself.”', '', '“About what?”', '', '“About calling you.”', '', 'This was good. Madeleine ran a finger along her lower lip. She said, “Have you calmed down or do you want to call back later?”', '', '“I’m resting comfortably now, thank you.”', '', 'Madeleine waited for more.

Madeleine was chilled in her brown suede jacket as she walked to the restaurant where they’d agreed to meet. Afterward, they made their way to the Cable Car and found a sagging couch among the other mismatched sofas and armchairs that furnished the art-house cinema.', '', 'She had a hard time following the movie. The narrative cues weren’t as crisp as those of Hollywood, and the film had a dream-like quality, lush but discontinuous. The audience, being a college audience, laughed knowingly during the risqué European moments: when the huge-titted woman stuffed her huge tit into the young hero’s mouth; or when the old man up in the tree cried out, “I want a woman!” Fellini’s theme appeared to be the same as Roland Barthes’—love—but here it was Italian and all about the body instead of French and all about the mind. She wondered if Leonard had known what Amarcord was going to be about. She wondered if it was his way of getting her in the mood. As it so happened, she was in the mood, but no thanks to the movie. The movie was pretty to look at but confused her and made her feel naïve and suburban. It seemed both overly indulgent and overly male.', '', 'After it was over, they made their way out onto South Main. They had no stated destination. Madeleine was pleased to realize that Leonard, though tall, wasn’t too tall. If she wore heels, the top of her head came up higher than his shoulders, almost to his chin.', '', '“What did you think?” he said.', '', '“Well, at least now I know what Felliniesque is.”', '', 'The downtown skyline was on their left, across the river, the spire of the Superman building visible against the unnaturally pink city sky.

Do you like him?”', '', '“I read a little of The Recognitions,” Madeleine said.', '', 'They turned up Planet Street, climbing the slope.', '', '“Bellovian,” Leonard said. “It’s extra nice when they change the spelling slightly. Nabokovian already has the v. So does Chekhovian. The Russians have it made. Tolstoyan! That guy was an adjective waiting to happen.”', '', '“Don’t forget Tolstoyanism,” Madeleine said.', '', '“My God!” Leonard said. “A noun!

The Festivity is what is waited for, what is expected. What I expect of the promised presence is an unheard-of totality of pleasures, a banquet; I rejoice like the child laughing at the sight of the mother whose mere presence heralds and signifies a plenitude of satisfactions: I am about to have before me, and for myself, the “source of all good things.”', '“I am living through days as happy as those God keeps for his chosen people; and whatever becomes of me, I can never say that I have not tasted the purest joys of life.”', '', 'It was debatable whether or not Madeleine had fallen in love with Leonard the first moment she’d seen him. She hadn’t even known him then, and so what she’d felt was only sexual attraction, not love. Even after they’d gone out for coffee, she couldn’t say that what she was feeling was anything more than infatuation. But ever since the night when they went back to Leonard’s place after watching Amarcordand started fooling around, when Madeleine found that instead of being turned off by physical stuff, the way she often was with boys, instead of putting up with that or trying to overlook it, she’d spent the entire night worrying that she was turning Leonard off, worrying that her body wasn’t good enough, or that her breath was bad from the Caesar salad she’d unwisely ordered at dinner; worrying, too, about having suggested they order martinis because of the way Leonard had sarcastically said,', '', '“Sure. Martinis. We can pretend we’re Salinger characters”; after having had, as a consequence of all this anxiety, pretty much no sexual pleasure, despite the perfectly respectable session they’d put together; and after Leonard (like every guy) had immediately fallen asleep, leaving her to lie awake stroking his head and vaguely hoping she didn’t get a urinary tract infection, Madeleine asked herself if the fact that she’d just spent the whole night worrying wasn’t, in fact, a surefire sign that she was falling in love. And certainly after they’d spent the next three days at Leonard’s place having sex and eating pizza, after she’d relaxed enough to be able to come at least once in a while and finally to stop worrying so much about having an orgasm because her hunger for Leonard was in some way satisfied by his satisfaction, after she’d allowed herself to sit naked on his gross couch and to walk to the bathroom knowing he was staring at her (imperfect) ass, to root for food in his disgusting refrigerator, to read the brilliant half-page of philosophy paper sticking up out of his typewriter, and to hear him pee with taurine force into the toilet bowl, certainly, by the end of those three days, Madeleine knew she was in love.', '', 'But that didn’t mean she had to tell anyone. Especially Leonard.', '', 'Leonard Bankhead had a studio apartment on the third floor of a low-rent student building. The halls were full of bikes and junk mail. Stickers decorated the other tenants’ doors: a fluorescent marijuana leaf, a silk-screen Blondie. Leonard’s door, however, was as blank as the apartment inside. In the middle of the room, a twin mattress lay beside a plastic milk crate supporting a reading lamp. There was no desk, no bookcase, not even a table, only the nasty couch, with a typewriter on another milk crate in front of it. There was nothing on the walls but bits of masking tape and, in one corner, a small portrait of Leonard, done in pencil. The drawing showed Leonard as George Washington, wearing a tricorne hat and sheltering under a blanket at Valley Forge. The caption read:', '', '“You go. I like it here.”', '', 'Madeleine thought the handwriting looked feminine.', '', 'A ficus tree endured in the corner. Leonard moved it into the sun whenever he remembered to.

What?”', '', '“You’re watering my tree.”', '', '“The soil’s dry.”', '', '“You’re taking care of my tree.”', '', 'She stopped doing it after that.', '', 'There was a tiny kitchen where Leonard brewed and reheated the gallon of coffee he drank every day. A big greasy wok sat on the stove. The most Leonard did in the way of preparing a meal, however, was to pour Grape Nuts into the wok. With raisins. Raisins satisfied his fruit requirement.', '', 'The apartment had a message. The message said: I am an orphan. Abby and Olivia asked Madeleine what she and Leonard did together and she never had an answer. They didn’t do<!--?i--> anything. She came to his apartment and they lay down on the mattress and Leonard asked her how she was doing, really wanting to know.', '', 'What did they do? She talked; he listened; then he talked and she listened. She’d never met anyone, and certainly not a guy, who was so receptive, who took everything in. She guessed that Leonard’s shrink-like manner came from years of seeing shrinks himself, and though another of her rules was to never date guys who went to shrinks, Madeleine began to reconsider this prohibition. Back home, she and her sister had a phrase for serious emotional talks. They called it “having a heavy.” If a boy approached during one, the girls would look up and give warning:', '', '“We’re having a heavy.” And the boy would retreat. Until it was over. Until the heavy had passed.', '', 'Going out with Leonard was like having a heavy all the time. Whenever she was with him, Leonard gave her his full attention. He didn’t stare into her eyes or smother her the way Billy had, but he made it clear he was available. He offered little advice. Only listened, and murmured, reassuringly.', '', 'People often fell in love with their shrinks, didn’t they? That was called transference and was to be avoided. But what if you were already sleeping with your shrink? What if your shrink’s couch was already a bed?', '', 'And plus it wasn’t all heavy, the heavies. Leonard was funny. He told hilarious stories in a deadpan voice. His head sank into his shoulders, his eyes filled with rue, as his sentences drawled on. “Did I ever tell you I play an instrument? The summer my parents got divorced, they sent me to live with my grandparents in Buffalo. The people next door were Latvian, the Bruverises. And they both played the kokle.', '', 'Do you know what a kokle is?', '', 'It’s sort of like a zither, but Latvian.', '', '“Anyway, I used to hear Mr. and Mrs. Bruveris playing their kokles over in the next yard. It was an amazing sound. Sort of wild and over-stimulated on the one hand, but melancholy on the other. The kokle is the manic-depressive of the string family. Anyway, I was bored to death that summer. I was sixteen. Six foot one. One hundred and thirty-eight pounds. A major reefer smoker. I used to get high in my bedroom and blow the smoke out the window, and then I’d go out to the porch and listen to the Bruverises playing next door. Sometimes other people came over. Other kokle players. They set up lawn chairs in the backyard and they’d all sit there playing together. It was an orchestra! A kokle orchestra. Then one day they saw me watching and invited me over. They gave me potato salad and a grape Popsicle and I asked Mr. Bruveris how you played a kokle and he started giving me lessons. I used to go over there every day. They had an old kokle they let me borrow. I used to practice five, six hours a day. I was into it.', '', '“At the end of that summer, when I had to leave, the Bruverises gave me the kokle. To keep. I took it on the plane with me. I got a separate seat for it, like I was Rostropovich. My father had moved out of the house by then. So it was just me, my sister, and my mother. And I kept on practicing. I got good enough that I joined this band. We used to play at ethnic festivals and Orthodox weddings. We had these traditional costumes, embroidered vests, puffy sleeves, knee-high boots. Me and all the adults. Most of them were Latvian, some Russians, too. Our big number was ‘Otchi Tchornyia.’ That’s the only thing that saved me in high school. The kokle.”', '', '“Do you still play?”', '', '“Hell no. Are you kidding? The kokle?”', '', 'Listening to Leonard, Madeleine felt impoverished by her happy childhood. She never wondered why she acted the way she did, or what effect her parents had had on her personality. Being fortunate had dulled her powers of observation. Whereas Leonard noticed every little thing. For instance, they spent a weekend on Cape Cod (partly to visit Pilgrim Lake Laboratory, where Leonard was applying for a research fellowship), and as they were driving back, Leonard said, “What do you do? Just hold it?”', '', '“What?”', '', '“You just hold it. For two days. Until you get back home.”', '', 'As his meaning seeped in, she said, “I can’t believe you!”', '', '“You have never, ever, taken a dump in my presence.”', '', '“In your presence?”', '', '“When I am present. Or nearby.”', '', '“What’s wrong with that?”', '', '“What’s wrong with it? Nothing. If you’re talking about I-sleep-over-and-go-off-to-class-the-next-morning and then you go and take a dump, that’s understandable. But when we spend two, almost three days together, eating surf and turf, and you do not take a dump the entire time, I can only conclude that you are more than a little anal.”', '', '“So what? It’s embarrassing!” Madeleine said.', '', '“O.K.? I find it embarrassing.”', '', 'Leonard stared at her without expression and said, “Do you mind when I take a dump?”', '', '“Do we have to talk about this? It’s sort of gross.”', '', '“I think we do need to talk about it. Because you’re obviously not very relaxed around me, and I am—or thought I was—your boyfriend, and that means—or should mean—that I’m the person you’re most relaxed around. Leonard equals maximum relaxation.”', '', 'Guys weren’t supposed to be the talkers. Guys weren’t supposed to get you to open up. But this guy was; this guy did. He’d said he was her “boyfriend,” too. He’d made it official.', '', '“I’ll try to be more relaxed,” Madeleine said, “if it’ll make you happy. But in terms of—excretion—don’t get your hopes up.”', '', '“This isn’t for me,” Leonard said. “This is for Mr. Lower Intestine. This is for Mr. Duodenum.”', '', 'Even though this kind of amateur therapy didn’t exactly work (after that last conversation, for instance, Madeleine had more, not less, trouble going Number 2 if Leonard was within a mile), it affected Madeleine deeply. Leonard was examining her closely. She felt handled in the right way, like something precious or immensely fascinating. It made her happy to think about how much he thought about her.', '', 'By the end of April, Madeleine and Leonard had gotten into a routine of spending every night together. On weeknights, after Madeleine finished studying, she headed over to the biology lab, where she’d find Leonard staring at slides with two Chinese grad students. After she finally got Leonard to leave the lab, Madeleine then had to cajole him into sleeping at her place. At first, Leonard had liked staying at the Narragansett. He liked the ornate moldings and the view from her bedroom. He charmed Olivia and Abby by making pancakes on Sunday mornings. But soon Leonard began to complain that they always stayed at Madeleine’s place and that he never got to wake up in his own bed. Staying at Leonard’s place, however, required Madeleine to bring a fresh set of clothes each night, and since he didn’t like her to leave clothes at his place (and, to be honest, she didn’t like to, either, because whatever she left picked up a fusty smell), Madeleine had to carry her dirty clothes around to classes all day. She preferred sleeping at her own apartment, where she could use her own shampoo, conditioner, and loofah, and where it was “clean-sheet day” every Wednesday. Leonard never changed his sheets. They were a disturbing gray color. Dust balls clung to the edges of the mattress. One morning, Madeleine was horrified to see a calligraphic smear of blood that had leaked from her three weeks earlier, a stain she’d attacked with a kitchen sponge while Leonard was sleeping.', '', '“You never wash your sheets!” she complained.', '', '“I wash them,” Leonard said evenly.', '', '“How often?”', '', '“When they get dirty.”', '', '“They’re always dirty.”', '', '“Not everyone can drop off their laundry at the cleaners every week. Not everybody grew up with ‘clean-sheet day.’”', '', '“You don’t have to drop them off,” Madeleine said, undeterred. “You’ve got a washer in the basement.”', '', '“I use the washer,” Leonard said. “Just not every Wednesday. I don’t equate dirt with death and decay.”', '', '“Oh, and I do? I’m obsessed with death because I wash my sheets?”', '', '“People’s attitudes to cleanliness have a lot to do with their fear of death.”', '', '“This isn’t about death, Leonard. This is about crumbs in the bed. This is about the fact that your pillow smells like a liverwurst sandwich.”', '', '“Wrong.”', '', '“It does!”', '', '“Wrong.”', '', '“Smell it, Leonard!”', '', '“It’s salami. I don’t like liverwurst.”', '', 'To a certain extent, this kind of arguing was fun. But then came nights when Madeleine forgot to pack a change of clothes and Leonard accused her of doing this on purpose in order to force him to sleep at her place. Next, more worryingly, came nights when Leonard said he was going home to study and would see her tomorrow. He began pulling all-nighters. One of his philosophy professors offered Leonard the use of his cabin in the Berkshires and, for an entire rainy weekend, Leonard went there, alone, to write a paper on Fichte, returning with a typescript 123 pages long and wearing a bright orange hunter’s vest. The vest became his favorite item of clothing. He wore it all the time.', '', 'He started finishing Madeleine’s sentences. As if her mind was too slow. As if he couldn’t wait for her to gather her thoughts. He riffed on the things she said, going off on strange tangents, making puns. Whenever she told him he needed to get some sleep, he got angry and didn’t call her for days. And it was during this period that Madeleine fully understood how the lover’s discourse was of an extreme solitude. The solitude was extreme because it wasn’t physical. It was extreme because you felt it while in the company of the person you loved. It was extreme because it was in your head, that most solitary of places.', '', 'The more Leonard pulled away, the more anxious Madeleine became. The more desperate she became, the more Leonard pulled away. She told herself to act cool. She went to the library to work on her marriage-plot thesis, but the sex-fantasy atmosphere—the reading-room eye contact, the beckoning stacks—made her desperate to see Leonard. And so against her will her feet began leading her back across campus through the darkness to the biology department. Up to the last moment, Madeleine had the crazy hope that this expression of weakness might in fact be strength. It was a brilliant strategy because it lacked all strategy. It involved no games, only sincerity. Seeing such sincerity, how could Leonard fail to respond? She was almost happy as she came up behind the lab table and tapped Leonard on the shoulder, and her happiness lasted until he turned around with a look not of love but of annoyance.', '', 'It didn’t help that it was spring. Every day, people seemed more and more unclothed. The magnolia trees, budding on the green, looked positively enflamed. They sent out a perfume that drifted through the windows of Semiotics 211. The magnolia trees hadn’t read Roland Barthes. They didn’t think love was a mental state; the magnolias insisted it was natural, perennial.', '', 'On a beautiful warm May day, Madeleine showered, shaved her legs with extra care, and put on her first spring dress: an apple-green baby-doll dress with a bib collar and a high hem. With this, she wore Buster Browns, cream and rust, and went sockless. Her bare legs, toned from a winter of squash-playing, were pale but smooth. She kept her glasses on, left her hair loose, and walked over to Leonard’s apartment on Planet Street. On the way, she stopped at a market to buy a hunk of cheese, some Stoned Wheat Thins, and a bottle of Valpolicella. Coming down the hill from Benefit toward South Main, she felt the warm breeze between her thighs. The front door of Leonard’s building was propped open with a brick, so she went up to his apartment and knocked. Leonard opened the door. He looked like he’d been napping.', '', '“Niiiiice dress,” he said.', '', 'They never made it to the park. They picnicked on each other. As Leonard pulled her toward the mattress, Madeleine dropped her packages, hoping the wine bottle didn’t break. She slipped her dress over her head. Soon they were naked, raiding, it felt like, a huge basket of goodies. Madeleine lay on her stomach, her side, her back, nibbling all the treats, the nice-smelling fruit candies, the meaty drumsticks, as well as more sophisticated offerings, the biscotti flavored with anise, the wrinkly truffles, the salty spoonfuls of olive tapenade. She’d never been so busy in her life. At the same time, she felt strangely displaced, not quite her usual tidy ego but merged with Leonard into a great big protoplasmic, ecstatic thing. She thought she’d been in love before. She knew she’d had sex before. But all those torrid adolescent gropings, all those awkward backseat romps, the meaningful, performative summer nights with her high school boyfriend Jim McManus, even the tender sessions with Billy where he insisted they look into each other’s eyes as they came—none of that prepared her for the wallop, the all-consuming pleasure, of this.', '', 'Leonard was kissing her. When she could bear no more, Madeleine grabbed him savagely by his ears. She pulled Leonard’s head away and held it still to show him the evidence of how she felt (she was crying now). In a hoarse voice edged with something else, a sense of peril, Madeleine said, “I love you.”', '', 'Leonard stared back at her. His eyebrows twitched. Suddenly, he rolled sideways off the mattress. He stood up and walked, naked, across the room. Crouching, he reached into her bag and pulled out A Lover’s Discourse, from the pocket where she always kept it. He flipped the pages until he found the one he wanted. Then he returned to the bed and handed the book to her.', '', 'I Love You', 'je-t’aime / I-love-you', '', 'As she read these words, Madeleine was flooded with happiness. She glanced up at Leonard, smiling. With his finger he motioned for her to keep going. The figure refers not to the declaration of love, to the avowal, but to the repeated utterance of the love cry.<!--?i--> Suddenly Madeleine’s happiness diminished, usurped by the feeling of peril. She wished she weren’t naked. She narrowed her shoulders and covered herself with the bedsheet as she obediently read on.', '', 'Once the first avowal has been made, “I love you"" has no meaning whatever …', '', 'Leonard, squatting, had a smirk on his face.', '', 'It was then that Madeleine threw the book at his head.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On $15, the hit would mean $9,000. Famous hits like that had bought controlling interests in lots of Harlem\'s bars and restaurants, or even bought some of them outright. The chances of hitting were a thousand to one. Many players practiced what was called ""combinating."" For example six cents would put one penny on each of the six possible combinations of three digits. The number 840, combinated, would include 840, 804, 048, 084, 408, and 480.', '', 'Practically everyone played every day in the poverty-ridden black ghetto of Harlem. Every day, someone you knew was likely to hit and of course it was neighborhood news; if big enough a hit, neighborhood excitement. Hits generally were small; a nickel, dime, or a quarter. Most people tried to play a dollar a day, but split it up among different numbers and combinated.', '', 'Harlem\'s numbers industry hummed every morning and into the early afternoon, with the runners jotting down people\'s bets on slips of paper in apartment house hallways, bars, barbershops, stores, on the sidewalks.

Many had lists of the daily hit numbers going back for years; they figured reappearance odds, and used other systems. Others played their hunches: addresses, license numbers of passing cars, any numbers on letters, telegrams, laundry slips, numbers from anywhere.

And from a Harlem point of view, I couldn\'t have been in a more educational situation. Some of the ablest of New York\'s black hustlers took a liking to me, and knowing that I still was green by their terms, soon began in a paternal way to ""straighten Red out.""', '', 'Their methods would be indirect. A dark, businessman-looking West Indian often would sit at one of my tables. One day when I brought his beer, he said, ""Red, hold still a minute."" He went over me with one of those yellow tape measures, and jotted figures in his notebook. When I came to work the next afternoon, one of the bartenders handed me a package. In it was an expensive, dark blue suit, conservatively cut. The gift was thoughtful, and the message clear.', '', ""The bartenders let me know that this customer was one of the top executives of the fabulous Forty Thieves gang. That was the gang of organized boosters, who would deliver, to order, in one day, C.O.D., any kind of garment you desired. You would pay about one-third of the store's price."", '', ""I heard how they made mass hauls. A well-dressed member of the gang who wouldn't arouse suspicion by his manner would go into a selected store about closing time, hide somewhere, and get locked inside when the store closed. The police patrols would have been timed beforehand. After dark, he'd pack suits in bags, then turn off the burglar alarm, and use the telephone to call a waiting truck and crew. When the truck came, timed with the police patrols, it would be loaded and gone within a few minutes. I later got to know several members of the Forty Thieves."", ""Plainclothes detectives soon were quietly identified to me, by a nod, a wink. Knowing the law people in the area was elementary for the hustlers, and, like them, in time I would learn to sense the presence of any police types. In late 1942, each of the military services had their civilian-dress eyes and ears picking up anything of interest to them, such as hustles being used to avoid the draft, or who hadn't registered, or hustles that were being worked on servicemen."", '', 'Longshoremen, or fences for them, would come into the bars selling guns, cameras, perfumes, watches, and the like, stolen from the shipping docks. These Negroes got what whitelongshoreman thievery left over. Merchant marine sailors often brought in foreign items, bargains, and the best marijuana cigarettes to be had were made of the gunja and kisca that merchant sailors smuggled in from Africa and Persia.', '', 'In the daytime, whites were given a guarded treatment. Whites who came at night got a better reception; the several Harlem nightclubs they patronized were geared to entertain and jive the night white crowd to get their money.', '', 'And with so many law agencies guarding the ""morals"" of servicemen, any of them that came in, and a lot did, were given what they asked for, and were spoken to if they spoke, and that was all, unless someone knew them as natives of Harlem.', '', ""What I was learning was the hustling society's first rule; that you never trusted anyone outside of your own close-mouthed circle, and that you selected with time and care before you made any intimates even among these."", '', 'The bartenders would let me know which among the regular customers were mostly ""fronts,"" and which really had something going; which were really in the underworld, with down-town police or political connections; which really handled some money, and which were making it from day to day; which were the real gamblers, and which had just hit a little luck; and which ones never to run afoul of in any way.', '', 'The latter were extremely well known about Harlem, and they were feared and respected. It was known that if upset, they would break open your head and think nothing of it. These were old-timers, not to be confused with the various hotheaded, wild, young hustlers out trying to make a name for themselves for being crazy with a pistol trigger or a knife. The old heads that I\'m talking about were such as ""Black Sammy,"" ""Bub"" Hewlett, ""King"" Padmore and ""West Indian Archie."" Most of these tough ones had worked as strongarm men for Dutch Schultz back when he muscled into the Harlem numbers industry after white gangsters had awakened to the fortunes being made in what they had previously considered ""nigger pennies""; and the numbers game was referred to by the white racketeers as ""nigger pool.""', '', 'Those tough Negroes\' heyday had been before the big 1931 Seabury Investigation that started Dutch Schultz on the way out, until his career ended with his 1934 assassination. I heard stories of how they had ""persuaded"" people with lead pipes, wet cement, baseball bats, brass knuckles, fists, feet, and blackjacks. Nearly every one of them had done some time, and had come back on the scene, and since had worked as top runners for the biggest bankers who specialized in large bettors.', '', ""There seemed to be an understanding that these Negroes and the tough black cops never clashed; I guess both knew that someone would die. They had some bad black cops in Harlem, too. The Four Horsemen that worked Sugar Hill -- I remember the worst one had freckles -- there was a tough quartet. The biggest, blackest, worst cop of them all in Harlem was the West Indian, Brisbane. Negroes crossed the street to avoid him when he walked his 125th Street and Seventh Avenue beat. When I was in prison, someone brought me a story that Brisbane had been shot to death by a scared, nervous young kid who hadn't been up from the South long enough to realize how bad Brisbane was."", '', 'The world\'s mostly unlikely pimp was ""Cadillac"" Drake. He was shiny baldheaded, built like a football; he used to call his huge belly ""the chippies\' playground."" Cadillac had a string of about a dozen of the stringiest, scrawniest, black and white street prostitutes in Harlem. Afternoons around the bar, the old-timers who knew Cadillac well enough would tease him about how women who looked like his made enough to feed themselves, let alone him. He\'d roar with laughter right along with us; I can hear him now, ""Bad-looking women work harder.""', '', 'Just about the complete opposite of Cadillac was the young, smooth, independent-acting pimp, ""Sammy the Pimp."" He could, as I have mentioned, pick out potential prostitutes by watching their expressions in dance halls. Sammy and I became, in time, each other\'s closest friend. Sammy, who was from Kentucky, was a cool, collected expert in his business, and his business was women. Like Cadillac, he too had both black and white women out making his living, but Sammy\'s women -- who would come into Small\'s sometimes, looking for him, to give him money, and have him buy them a drink -- were about as beautiful as any prostitutes who operated anywhere, I\'d imagine.', '', 'One of his white women, known as ""Alabama Peach,"" a blonde, could put everybody in stitches with her drawl; even the several Negro women numbers controllers around Small\'s really liked her. What made a lot of Negroes around the bar laugh the hardest was the way she would take three syllables to say ""nigger."" But what she usually was saying was ""Ah jes\' luuv ni-uh-guhs --."" Give her two drinks and she would tell her life story in a minute; how in whatever little Alabama town it was she came from, the first thing she remembered being conscious of was that she was supposed to ""hate niggers."" And then she started hearing older girls in grade school whispering the hush-hush that ""niggers"" were such sexual giants and athletes, and she started growing up secretly wanting to try one. Finally, right in her own house, with her family away, she threatened a Negro man who worked for her father that if he didn\'t take her she would swear he tried rape. He had no choice, except that he quit working for them. And from then until she finished high school, she managed it several times with other Negroes -- and she somehow came to New York, and went straight to Harlem. Later on, Sammy told me how he had happened to spot her in the Savoy, not even dancing with anybody, just standing on the sidelines, watching, and he could tell. And once she really went for Negroes, the more the better, Sammy said, and wouldn\'t have a white man. I have wondered what ever became of her.', '', 'There was a big, fat pimp we called ""Dollarbill."" He loved to flash his ""Kansas City roll,"" probably fifty one-dollar bills folded with a twenty on the inside and a one-hundred dollar bill on the outside. We always wondered what Dollarbill would do if someone ever stole his hundred-dollar ""cover.""', 'A man who, in his prime, could have stolen Dollarbill\'s whole roll, blindfolded, was threadbare, comic old ""Fewclothes."" Fewclothes had been one of the best pickpockets in Harlem, back when the white people swarmed up every night in the 1920\'s, but then during the Depression, he had contracted a bad case of arthritis in his hands. His finger joints were knotted and gnarled so that it made people uncomfortable to look at them. Rain, sleet, or snow, every afternoon, about six, Fewclothes would be at Small\'s, telling tall tales about the old days, and it was one of the day\'s rituals for one or another regular customer to ask the bartender to give him drinks, and me to feed him.', '', 'My heart goes out to all of us who in those afternoons at Small\'s enacted our scene with Fewclothes. I wish you could have seen him, pleasantly ""high"" with drinks, take his seat with dignity -- no begging, not on anybody\'s Welfare -- and open his napkin, and study the day\'s menu that I gave him, and place his order. I\'d tell the cooks it was Fewclothes and he\'d get the best in the house. I\'d go back and serve it as though he were a millionaire.', '', 'Many times since, I have thought about it, and what it really meant. In one sense, we were huddled in there, bonded together in seeking security and warmth and comfort from each other, and we didn\'t know it. All of us -- who might have probed space, or cured cancer, or built industries -- were, instead, black victims of the white man\'s American social system. In another sense, the tragedy of the once master pickpocket made him, for those brother old-timer hustlers, a ""there but for the grace of God"" symbol. To wolves who still were able to catch some rabbits, it had meaning that an old wolf who had lost his fangs was still eating.', '', 'Then there was the burglar, ""Jumpsteady."" In the ghettoes the white man has built for us, he has forced us not to aspire to greater things, but to view everyday living as survival -- and in that kind of a community, survival is what is respected. In any average white neighborhood bar, you couldn\'t imagine a known cat-man thief regularly exposing himself, as one of the most popular people in there. But if Jumpsteady missed a few days running in Small\'s, we would begin inquiring for him.', '', ""Jumpsteady was called that because, it was said, when he worked in white residential areas downtown, he jumped from roof to roof and was so steady that he maneuvered along window ledges, leaning, balancing, edging with his toes. If he fell, he'd have been dead. He got into apartments through windows. It was said that he was so cool that he had stolen even with people in the next room. I later found out that Jumpsteady always keyed himself up high on dope when he worked. He taught me some things that I was to employ in later years when hard times would force me to have my own burglary ring."", '', 'I should stress that Small\'s wasn\'t any nest of criminals. I dwell upon the hustlers because it was their world that fascinated me. Actually, for the night-life crowd, Small\'s was one of Harlem\'s two or three most decorous night spots. In fact, the New York City police department recommended Small\'s to white people who would ask for a ""safe"" place in Harlem.', '', ""The first room I got after I left the railroad (half of Harlem roomed) was in the 800 block of St. Nicholas Avenue. You could walk into one or another room in this house and get a hot fur coat, a good camera, fine perfume, a gun, anything from hot women to hot cars, even hot ice. I was one of the very few males in this rooming house. This was during the war, when you couldn't turn on the radio and not hear about Guadalcanal or North Africa. In several of the apartments the women tenants were prostitutes. The minority were in some other racket or hustle -- boosters, numbers runners, or dope-peddlers -- and I'd guess that everyone who lived in the house used dope of some kind. This shouldn't reflect too badly on that particular building, because almost everyone in Harlem needed some kind of hustle to survive, and needed to stay high in some way to forget what they had to do to survive."", '', ""It was in this house that I learned more about women than I ever did in any other single place. It was these working prostitutes who schooled me to things that every wife and every husband should know. Later on, it was chiefly the women who weren't prostitutes who taught me to be very distrustful of most women; there seemed to be a higher code of ethics and sisterliness among those prostitutes than among numerous ladies of the church who have more men for kicks than the prostitutes have for pay. And I am talking about both black and white. Many of the black ones in those wartime days were right in step with the white ones in having husbands fighting overseas while they were laying up with other men, even giving them their husbands' money. And many women just faked as mothers and wives, while playing the field as hard as prostitutes -- with their husbands and children right there in New York."", '', ""I got my first schooling about the cesspool morals of the white man from the best possible source, from his own women. And then as I got deeper into my own life of evil, I saw the white man's morals with my own eyes. I even made my living helping to guide him to the sick things he wanted."", '', ""I was young, working in the bar, not bothering with these women. Probably I touched their kid-brother instincts, something like that. Some would drop into my room when they weren't busy, and we would smoke reefers and talk. It generally would be after their morning rush -- but let me tell you about that rush."", '', 'Seeing the hallways and stairs busy any hour of the night with white and black men coming and going was no more than one would expect when one lived in a building out of which prostitutes were working. But what astonished me was the fullhouse crowd that rushed in between, say, six and seven-thirty in the morning, then rushed away, and by about nine, I would be the only man in the house.', '', 'It was husbands -- who had left home in time to stop by this St. Nicholas Avenue house before they went on to work. Of course not the same ones every day, but always enough of them to make up the rush. And it included white men who had come in cabs all the way up from downtown.', '', 'Domineering, complaining, demanding wives who had just about psychologically castrated their husbands were responsible for the early rush. These wives were so disagreeable and had made their men so tense that they were robbed of the satisfaction of being men. To escape this tension and the chance of being ridiculed by his own wife, each of these men had gotten up early and come to a prostitute.', ""The prostitutes had to make it their business to be students of men. They said that after most men passed their virile twenties, they went to bed mainly to satisfy their egos, and because a lot of women don't understand it that way, they damage and wreck a man's ego. No matter how little virility a man has to offer, prostitutes make him feel for a time that he is the greatest man in the world. That's why these prostitutes had that morning rush of business. More wives could keep their husbands if they realized their greatest urge is to be men."", '', 'Those women would tell me anything. Funny little stories about the bedroom differences they saw between white and black men. The perversities! I thought I had heard the whole range of perversities until I later became a steerer taking white men to what they wanted. Everyone in the house laughed about the little Italian fellow whom they called the ""Ten Dollar A Minute Man."" He came without fail every noontime, from his little basement restaurant up near the Polo Grounds; the joke was he never lasted more than two minutes . . . but he always left twenty dollars.', '', 'Most men, the prostitutes felt, were too easy to push around. Every day these prostitutes heard their customers complaining that they never heard anything but griping from women who were being taken care of and given everything. The prostitutes said that most men needed to know what the pimps knew. A woman should occasionally be babied enough to show her the man had affection, but beyond that she should be treated firmly. These tough women said that it worked with them. All women, by their nature, are fragile and weak: they are attracted to the male in whom they see strength.', '', ""From time to time, Sophia would come over to see me from Boston. Even among Harlem Negroes, her looks gave me status. They were just like the Negroes everywhere else. That was why the white prostitutes made so much money. It didn't make any difference if you were in Lansing, Boston, or New York -- what the white racist said, and still says, was right in those days! All you had to do was put a white girl anywhere close to the average black man, and he would respond. The black woman also made the white man's eyes light up -- but he was slick enough to hide it."", '', 'Sophia would come in on a late afternoon train. She would come to Small\'s and I\'d introduce her around until I got off from work. She was bothered about me living among the prostitutes until I introduced her to some of them, and they talked, and she thought they were great. They would tell her they were keeping me straight for her. We would go to the Braddock Hotel bar, where we would meet some of the musicians who now would greet me like an old friend, ""Hey, Red -- who have we got here?"" They would make a big deal over her; I couldn\'t even think about buying a drink. No Negroes in the world were more white-woman-crazy in those days than most of those musicians. People in show business, of course, were less inhibited by social and racial taboos.', '', 'The white racist won\'t tell you that it also works in reverse. When it got late, Sophia and I would go to some of the after-hours places and speakeasies. When the downtown nightclubs had closed, most of these Harlem places crawled with white people. These whites were just mad for Negro ""atmosphere,"" especially some of the places which had what you might call Negro soul. Sometimes Negroes would talk about how a lot of whites seemed unable to have enough of being close around us, and among us -- in groups. Both white men and women, it seemed, would get almost mesmerized by Negroes.', '', 'I remember one really peculiar case of this -- a white girl who never missed a single night in the Savoy Ballroom. She fascinated my friend Sammy; he had watched her several times. Dancing only with Negroes, she seemed to go nearly into a trance. If a white man asked her to dance, she would refuse. Then when the place was ready to close, early in the morning, she would let a Negro take her as far as the subway entrance. And that was it. She never would tell anyone her name, let alone reveal where she lived.', '', ""Now, I'll tell you another peculiar case that worked out differently, and which taught me something I have since learned in a thousand other ways. This was my best early lesson in how most white men's hearts and guts will turn over inside of them, whatever they may have you otherwise believe, whenever they see a Negro man on close terms with a white woman."", '', 'A few of the white men around Harlem, younger ones whom we called ""hippies,"" acted more Negro than Negroes. This particular one talked more ""hip"" talk than we did. He would have fought anyone who suggested he felt any race difference. Musicians around the Braddock could hardly move without falling over him. Every time I saw him, it was ""Daddy! Come on, let\'s get our heads tight!"" Sammy couldn\'t stand him; he was under-foot wherever you went. He even wore a wild zoot suit, used a heavy grease in his hair to make it look like a conk, and he wore the knob-toed shoes, the long, swinging chain -- everything. And he not only wouldn\'t be seen with any woman but a black one, but in fact he lived with two of them in the same little apartment. I never was sure how they worked that one out, but I had my idea.', '', 'About three or four o\'clock one morning, we ran into this white boy, in Creole Bill\'s speakeasy. He was high -- in that marijuana glow where the world relaxes. I introduced Sophia; I went away to say hello to someone else. When I returned, Sophia looked peculiar -- but she wouldn\'t tell me until we left. He had asked her, ""Why is a white girl like you throwing yourself away with a spade?""', '', ""Creole Bill -- naturally you know he was from New Orleans -- became another good friend of mine. After Small's closed, I'd bring fast-spending white people who still wanted some drinking action to Creole Bill's speakeasy. That was my earliest experience at steering. The speakeasy was only Creole Bill's apartment. I think a partition had been knocked out to make the living room larger. But the atmosphere, plus the food, made the place one of Harlem's soul spots."", '', 'A record player maintained the right, soft music. There was any kind of drink. And Bill sold plates of his spicy, delicious Creole dishes -- gumbo, jambalaya. Bill\'s girl friend -- a beautiful black girl -- served the customers. Bill called her ""Brown Sugar,"" and finally everyone else did. If a good number of customers were to be served at one time, Creole Bill would bring out some pots, Brown Sugar would bring the plates, and Bill would serve everyone big platefuls; and he\'d heap a plate for himself and eat with us. It was a treat to watch him eat; he loved his food so; it was good. Bill could cook rice like the Chinese -- I mean rice that stood every grain on its own, but I never knew the Chinese to do what Bill could with seafood and beans.', '', ""Bill made money enough in that apartment speakeasy to open up a Creole restaurant famous in Harlem. He was a great baseball fan. All over the walls were framed, autographed photographs of major league stars, and also some political and show business celebrities who would come there to eat, bringing friends. I wonder what's become of Creole Bill? His place is sold, and I haven't heard anything of him. I must remember to ask some of the Seventh Avenue old-timers, who would know."", '', ""Once, when I called Sophia in Boston, she said she couldn't get away until the following weekend. She had just married some well-to-do Boston white fellow. He was in the service, he had been home on leave, and he had just gone back. She didn't mean it to change a thing between us. I told her it made no difference. I had of course introduced Sophia to my friend Sammy, and we had gone out together some nights. And Sammy and I had thoroughly discussed the black man and white woman psychology. I had Sammy to thank that I was entirely prepared for Sophia's marriage."", '', 'Sammy said that white women were very practical; he had heard so many of them express how they felt. They knew that the black man had all the strikes against him, that the white man kept the black man down, under his heel, unable to get anywhere, really. The white woman wanted to be comfortable, she wanted to be looked upon with favor by her own kind, but also she wanted to have her pleasure. So some of them just married a white man for convenience and security, and kept right on going with a Negro. It wasn\'t that they were necessarily in love with the Negro, but they were in love with lust -- particularly ""taboo"" lust.', '', ""A white man was not too unusual if he had a ten-, twenty-, thirty-, forty-, or fifty-thousand-dollar-a-year job. A Negro man who made even five thousand in the white man's world was unusual. The white woman with a Negro man would be with him for one of two reasons: either extremely insane love, or to satisfy her lust."", '', 'When I had been around Harlem long enough to show signs of permanence, inevitably I got a nickname that would identify me beyond any confusion with two other red-conked and well-known ""Reds"" who were around. I had met them both; in fact, later on I\'d work with them both. One, ""St. Louis Red,"" was a professional armed robber. When I was sent to prison, he was serving time for trying to stick up a dining car steward on a train between New York and Philadelphia. He was finally freed; now, I hear, he is in prison for a New York City jewel robbery.', '', 'The other was ""Chicago Red."" We became good buddies in a speakeasy where later on I was a waiter; Chicago Red was the funniest dishwasher on this earth. Now he\'s making his living being funny as a nationally known stage and nightclub comedian. I don\'t see any reason why old Chicago Red would mind me telling that he is Redd Foxx.', '', 'Anyway, before long, my nickname happened. Just when, I don\'t know -- but people, knowing I was from Michigan, would ask me what city. Since most New Yorkers had never heard of Lansing, I would name Detroit. Gradually, I began to be called ""Detroit Red"" -- and it stuck.', '', ""One afternoon in early 1943, before the regular six o'clock crowd had gathered, a black soldier sat drinking by himself at one of my tables. He must have been there an hour or more. He looked dumb and pitiful and just up from the Deep South. The fourth or fifth drink I served this soldier, wiping the table I bent over close and asked him if he wanted a woman."", '', 'I knew better. It wasn\'t only Small\'s Paradise law, it was the law of every tavern that wanted to stay in business -- never get involved with anything that could be interpreted as ""impairing the morals"" of servicemen, or any kind of hustling off them. This had caused trouble for dozens of places: some had been put off limits by the military; some had lost their state or city licenses.', '', 'I played right into the hands of a military spy. He sure would like a woman. He acted so grateful. He even put on an extreme Southern accent. And I gave him the phone number of one of my best friends among the prostitutes where I lived.', '', 'But something felt wrong. I gave the fellow a half-hour to get there, and then I telephoned. I expected the answer I got -- that no soldier had been there.', '', ""I didn't even bother to go back out to the bar. I just went straight to Charlie Small's office."", '', '""I just did something, Charlie,"" I said. ""I don\'t know why I did it --"" and I told him.', '', 'Charlie looked at me. ""I wish you hadn\'t done that, Red."" We both knew what he meant.', '', ""When the West Indian plainclothes detective, Joe Baker, came in, I was waiting. I didn't even ask him any questions. When we got to the 135th Street precinct, it was busy with police in uniform, and MP's with soldiers in tow. I was recognized by some other detectives who, like Joe Baker, sometimes dropped in at Small's."", '', ""Two things were in my favor. I'd never given the police any trouble, and when that black spy soldier had tried to tip me, I had waved it away, telling him I was just doing him a favor. They must have agreed that Joe Baker should just scare me."", '', 'I didn\'t know enough to be aware that I wasn\'t taken to the desk and booked. Joe Baker took me back inside of the precinct building, into a small room. In the next room, we could hear somebody getting whipped. Whop! Whop! He\'d cry out, ""Please! Please don\'t beat my face, that\'s how I make my living!"" I knew from that it was some pimp. Whop! Whop! ""Please! Please!""', '', '(Not much later, I heard that Joe Baker had gotten trapped over in New Jersey, shaking down a Negro pimp and his white prostitute. He was discharged from the New York City police force, the State of New Jersey convicted him, and he went off to do some time.)', '', 'More bitter than getting fired, I was barred from Small\'s. I could understand. Even if I wasn\'t actually what was called ""hot,"" I was now going to be under surveillance -- and the Small brothers had to protect their business.', '', 'Sammy proved to be my friend in need. He put the word on the wire for me to come over to his place. I had never been there. His place seemed to me a small palace; his women really kept him in style. While we talked about what kind of a hustle', '', ""I should get into, Sammy gave me some of the best marijuana I'd ever used."", '', ""Various numbers controllers, Small's regulars, had offered me jobs as a runner. But that meant I would earn very little until I could build up a clientele. Pimping, as Sammy did, was out. I felt I had no abilities in that direction, and that I'd certainly starve to death trying to recruit prostitutes."", '', 'Peddling reefers, Sammy and I pretty soon agreed, was the best thing. It was a relatively uninvolved lone-wolf type of operation, and one in which I could make money immediately. For anyone with even a little brains, no experience was needed, especially if one had any knack at all with people.', '', 'Both Sammy and I knew some merchant seamen and others who could supply me with loose marijuana. And musicians, among whom I had so many good contacts, were the heaviest consistent market for reefers. And then, musicians also used the heavier narcotics, if I later wanted to graduate to them. That would be more risky, but also more money. Handling heroin and cocaine could earn one hundreds of dollars a day, but it required a lot of experience with the narcotics squad for one to be able to last long enough to make anything.', '', ""I had been around long enough either to know or to spot instinctively most regular detectives and cops, though not the narcotics people. And among the Small's veteran hustler regulars, I had a variety of potentially helpful contacts. This was important because just as Sammy could get me supplied with marijuana, a large facet of any hustler's success was knowing where he could get help when he needed it. The help could involve police and detectives -- as well as higher ups. But I hadn't yet reached that stage. So Sammy staked me, about twenty dollars, I think it was."", '', 'Later that same night, I knocked at his door and gave him back his money and asked him if I could lend him some. I had gone straight from Sammy\'s to a supplier he had mentioned. I got just a small amount of marijuana, and I got some of the paper to roll up my own sticks. As they were only about the size of stick matches, I was able to make enough of them so that, after selling them to musicians I knew at the Braddock Hotel, I could pay back Sammy and have enough profit to be in business. And those musicians when they saw their buddy, and their fan, in business: ""My man!"" ""Crazy, Red!""', '', 'In every band, at least half of the musicians smoked reefers. I\'m not going to list names; I\'d have to include some of those most prominent then in popular music, even a number of them around today. In one case, every man in one of the bands which is still famous was on marijuana. Or again, any number of musicians could tell you who I mean when I say that one of the most famous singers smoked his reefers through a chicken thighbone. He had smoked so many through the bone that he could just light a match before the empty bone, draw the heat through, and get what he called a ""contact"" high.', '', 'I kept turning over my profit, increasing my supplies, and I sold reefers like a wild man. I scarcely slept; I was wherever musicians congregated. A roll of money was in my pocket. Every day, I cleared at least fifty or sixty dollars. In those days (or for that matter these days), this was a fortune to a seventeen-year-old Negro. I felt, for the first time in my life, that great feeling of free! Suddenly, now, I was the peer of the other young hustlers I had admired.', '', ""It was at this time that I discovered the movies. Sometimes I made as many as five in one day, both downtown and in Harlem. I loved the tough guys, the action, Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca, and I loved all of that dancing and carrying on in such films as Stormy Weather and Cabin in the Sky. After leaving the movies, I'd make my connections for supplies, then roll my sticks, and, about dark, I'd start my rounds. I'd give a couple of extra sticks when someone bought ten, which was five dollars' worth. And I didn't sell and run, because my customers were my friends. Often I'd smoke along with them. None of them stayed any more high than I did."", '', ""Free now to do what I pleased, upon an impulse I went to Boston. Of course, I saw Ella. I gave her some money: it was just a token of appreciation, I told her, for helping me when I had come from Lansing. She wasn't the same old Ella; she still hadn't forgiven me for Laura. She never mentioned her, nor did I. But, even so, Ella acted better than she had when I had left for New York. We reviewed the family changes. Wilfred had proved so good at his trade they had asked him to stay on at Wilberforce as an instructor. And Ella had gotten a card from Reginald who had managed to get into the merchant marine."", '', ""From Shorty's apartment, I called Sophia. She met me at the apartment just about as Shorty went off to work. I would have liked to take her out to some of the Roxbury clubs, but Shorty had told us that, as in New York, the Boston cops used the war as an excuse to harass interracial couples, stopping them and grilling the Negro about his draft status. Of course Sophia's now being married made us more cautious, too."", '', 'When Sophia caught a cab home, I went to hear Shorty\'s band. Yes, he had a band now. He had succeeded in getting a 4-F classification, and I was pleased for him and happy to go. His band was -- well, fair. But Shorty was making out well in Boston, playing in small clubs. Back in the apartment, we talked into the next day. ""Homeboy, you\'re something else!"" Shorty kept saying. I told him some of the wild things I\'d done in Harlem, and about the friends I had. I told him the story of Sammy the Pimp.', '', ""In Sammy's native Paducah, Kentucky, he had gotten a girl pregnant. Her parents made it so hot that Sammy had come to Harlem, where he got a job as a restaurant waiter. When a woman came in to eat alone, and he found she really was alone, not married, or living with somebody, it generally was not hard for smooth Sammy to get invited to her apartment. He'd insist on going out to a nearby restaurant to bring back some dinner, and while he was out he would have her key duplicated. Then, when he knew she was away, Sammy would go in and clean out all her valuables. Sammy was then able to offer some little stake, to help her back on her feet. This could be the beginning of an emotional and financial dependency, which Sammy knew how to develop until she was his virtual slave."", '', ""Around Harlem, the narcotics squad detectives didn't take long to find out I was selling reefers, and occasionally one of them would follow me. Many a peddler was in jail because he had been caught with the evidence on his person; I figured a way to avoid that. The law specified that if the evidence wasn't actually in your possession, you couldn't be arrested. Hollowed-out shoe heels, fake hat-linings, these things were old stuff to the detectives."", '', ""I carried about fifty sticks in a small package inside my coat, under my armpit, keeping my arm flat against my side. Moving about, I kept my eyes open. If anybody looked suspicious, I'd quickly cross the street, or go through a door, or turn a corner, loosening my arm enough to let the package drop. At night, when I usually did my selling, any suspicious person wouldn't be likely to see the trick. If I decided I had been mistaken, I'd go back and get my sticks."", '', 'However, I lost many a stick this way. Sometimes, I knew I had frustrated a detective. And I kept out of the courts.', '', 'One morning, though, I came in and found signs that my room had been entered. I knew it had been detectives. I\'d heard too many times how if they couldn\'t find any evidence, they would plant some, where you would never find it, then they\'d come back in and ""find"" it. I didn\'t even have to think twice what to do. I packed my few belongings and never looked back. When I went to sleep again, it was in another room.', '', 'It was then that I began carrying a little .25 automatic. I got it, for some reefers, from an addict who I knew had stolen it somewhere. I carried it pressed under my belt right down the center of my back. Someone had told me that the cops never hit there in any routine patting-down. And unless I knew who I was with, I never allowed myself to get caught in any crush of people. The narcotics cops had been known to rush up and get their hands on you and plant evidence while ""searching."" I felt that as long as I kept on the go, and in the open, I had a good chance. I don\'t know now what my real thoughts were about carrying the pistol. But I imagine I felt that I wasn\'t going to get put away if somebody tried framing me in any situation that I could help.', '', ""I sold less than before because having to be so careful consumed so much time. Every now and then, on a hunch, I'd move to another room. I told nobody but Sammy where I slept."", '', 'Finally, it was on the wire that the Harlem narcotics squad had me on its special list.', '', ""Now, every other day or so, usually in some public place, they would flash the badge to search me. But I'd tell them at once, loud enough for others standing about to hear me, that I had nothing on me, and I didn't want to get anything planted on me. Then they wouldn't, because Harlem already thought little enough of the law, and they did have to be careful that some crowd of Negroes would not intervene roughly. Negroes were starting to get very tense in Harlem. One could almost smell trouble ready to break out -- as it did very soon."", '', ""But it was really tough on me then. I was having to hide my sticks in various places near where I was selling. I'd put five sticks in an empty cigarette pack, and drop the empty-looking pack by a lamppost, or behind a garbage can, or a box. And I'd first tell customers to pay me, and then where to pick up."", '', ""But my regular customers didn't go for that. You couldn't expect a well-known musician to go grubbing behind a garbage can. So I began to pick up some of the street trade, the people you could see looked high. I collected a number of empty Red Cross bandage boxes and used them for drops. That worked pretty good."", '', ""But the middle-Harlem narcotics force found so many ways to harass me that I had to change my area. I moved down to lower Harlem, around 110th Street. There were many more reefer smokers around there, but these were a cheaper type, this was the worst of the ghetto, the poorest people, the ones who in every ghetto keep themselves narcotized to keep from having to face their miserable existence. I didn't last long down there, either. I lost too much of my product. After I sold to some of those reefer smokers who had the instincts of animals, they followed me and learned my pattern. They would dart out of a doorway, I'd drop my stuff, and they would be on it like a chicken on corn. When you become an animal, a vulture, in the ghetto, as I had become, you enter a world of animals and vultures. It becomes truly the survival of only the fittest."", '', 'Soon I found myself borrowing little stakes, from Sammy, from some of the musicians. Enough to buy supplies, enough to keep high myself, enough sometimes to just eat.', '', 'Then Sammy gave me an idea.', '', '""Red, you still got your old railroad identification?"" I did have it. They hadn\'t taken it back. ""Well, why don\'t you use it to make a few runs, until the heat cools?""', '', 'He was right.', '', ""I found that if you walked up and showed a railroad line's employee identification card, the conductor -- even a real cracker, if you approached him right, not begging -- would just wave you aboard. And when he came around he would punch you one of those little coach seat slips to ride wherever the train went."", '', 'The idea came to me that, this way, I could travel all over the East Coast selling reefers among my friends who were on tour with their bands.', '', 'I had the New Haven identification. I worked a couple of weeks for other railroads, to get their identification, and then I was set.', '', ""In New York, I rolled and packed a great quantity of sticks, and sealed them into jars. The identification card worked perfectly. If you persuaded the conductor you were a fellow employee who had to go home on some family business, he just did the favor for you without a second thought. Most whites don't give a Negro credit for having sense enough to fool them -- or nerve enough."", '', 'I\'d turn up in towns where my friends were playing. ""Red!"" I was an old friend from home. In the sticks, I was somebody from the Braddock Hotel. ""My man! Daddy-o!"" And I had Big Apple reefers. Nobody had ever heard of a traveling reefer peddler.', '', ""I followed no particular band. Each band's musicians knew the other bands' one-nighter touring schedules. When I ran out of supplies, I'd return to New York, and load up, then hit the road again. Auditoriums or gymnasiums all lighted up, the band's chartered bus outside, the dressed-up, excited, local dancers pouring in. At the door, I'd announce that I was some bandman's brother; in most cases they thought I was one of the musicians. Throughout the dance, I'd show the country folks some plain and fancy lindy-hopping. Sometimes, I'd stay overnight in a town. Sometimes I'd ride the band's bus to their next stop. Sometimes, back in New York, I would stay awhile. Things had cooled down. Word was around that I had left town, and the narcotics squad was satisfied with that. In some of the small towns, people thinking I was with the band even mobbed me for autographs. Once, in Buffalo, my suit was nearly torn off."", '', ""My brother Reginald was waiting for me one day when I pulled into New York. The day before, his merchant ship had put into port over in New Jersey. Thinking I still worked at Small's, Reginald had gone there, and the bartenders had directed him to Sammy, who put him up."", '', 'It felt good to see my brother. It was hard to believe that he was once the little kid who tagged after me. Reginald now was almost six feet tall, but still a few inches shorter than me. His complexion was darker than mine, but he had greenish eyes, and a white streak in his hair, which was otherwise dark reddish, something like mine.', '', 'I took Reginald everywhere, introducing him. Studying my brother, I liked him. He was a lot more self-possessed than I had been at sixteen.', '', ""I didn't have a room right at the time, but I had some money, so did Reginald, and we checked into the St. Nicholas Hotel on Sugar Hill. It has since been torn down."", '', ""Reginald and I talked all night about the Lansing years, about our family. I told him things about our father and mother that he couldn't remember.

I was pleased to see that Reginald, though he said little about it, admired my living by my wits. Reginald dressed a little too loudly, I thought. I got a reefer customer of mine to get him a more conservative overcoat and suit. I told Reginald what I had learned: that in order to get something you had to look as though you already had something."", '', 'Before Reginald left, I urged him to leave the merchant marine and I would help him get started in Harlem. I must have felt that having my kid brother around me would be a good thing. Then there would be two people I could trust -- Sammy was the other.', '', 'Reginald was cool. At his age, I would have been willing to run behind the train, to get to New York and to Harlem. But Reginald, when he left, said, ""I\'ll think about it.""', '', ""Not long after Reginald left, I dragged out the wildest zoot suit in New York. This was 1943.

The tender-looking ones appeared ready to run from me. Some others had that vinegary ""worst kind of nigger"" look. And a few were amused, seeing me as the ""Harlem jigaboo"" archetype.', '', ""Also amused were some of the room's ten or twelve Negroes. But the stony-faced rest of them looked as if they were ready to sign up to go off killing somebody -- they would have liked to start with me."", '', 'The line moved along.

Back then, the white man during the war was so pressed for personnel that he began letting some Negroes put down their buckets and mops and dust rags and use a pencil, or sit at some desk, or hold some twenty-five-cent title. You couldn\'t read the Negro press for the big pictures of smug black ""firsts.""', '', ""Somebody was inside with the psychiatrist. I didn't even have to put on any act for this black girl; she was already sick of me."", '', 'When, finally, a buzz came at her desk, she didn\'t send me, she went in. I knew what she was doing, she was going to make clear, in advance, what she thought of me. This is still one of the black man\'s big troubles today. So many of those so-called ""upper-class"" Negroes are so busy trying to impress on the white man that they are ""different from those others"" that they can\'t see they are only helping the white man to keep his low opinion of all Negroes.', '', 'And then, with her prestige in the clear, she came out and nodded to me to go in.', '', 'I must say this for that psychiatrist. He tried to be objective and professional in his manner. He sat there and doodled with his blue pencil on a tablet, listening to me spiel to him for three or four minutes before he got a word in.', '', ""His tack was quiet questions, to get at why I was so anxious. I didn't rush him; I circled and hedged, watching him closely, to let him think he was pulling what he wanted out of me. I kept jerking around, backward, as though somebody might be listening. I knew I was going to send him back to the books to figure what kind of a case I was."", '', 'Suddenly, I sprang up and peeped under both doors, the one I\'d entered and another that probably was a closet. And then I bent and whispered fast in his ear. ""Daddy-o, now you and me, we\'re from up North here, so don\'t you tell nobody. . . . I want to get sent down South. Organize them nigger soldiers, you dig? Steal us some guns, and kill us crackers!""', '', 'That psychiatrist\'s blue pencil dropped, and his professional manner fell off in all directions.

I was going back out past Miss First when he said, ""That will be all.""', '', 'A 4-F card came to me in the mail, and I never heard from the Army anymore, and never bothered to ask why I was rejected.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Or buy your coach.”', '', 'Vaccaro’s audience, the members of the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics, bristled. These were eminent reformers—among them the president of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, two former heads of the U.S. Olympic Committee, and several university presidents and chancellors. The Knight Foundation, a nonprofit that takes an interest in college athletics as part of its concern with civic life, had tasked them with saving college sports from runaway commercialism as embodied by the likes of Vaccaro, who, since signing his pioneering shoe contract with Michael Jordan in 1984, had built sponsorship empires successively at Nike, Adidas, and Reebok. Not all the members could hide their scorn for the “sneaker pimp” of schoolyard hustle, who boasted of writing checks for millions to everybody in higher education.', '', '“Why,” asked Bryce Jordan, the president emeritus of Penn State, “should a university be an advertising medium for your industry?”', '', 'Vaccaro did not blink. “They shouldn’t, sir,” he replied. “You sold your souls, and you’re going to continue selling them. You can be very moral and righteous in asking me that question, sir,” Vaccaro added with irrepressible good cheer, “but there’s not one of you in this room that’s going to turn down any of our money. You’re going to take it. I can only offer it.”', '', 'William Friday, a former president of North Carolina’s university system, still winces at the memory. “Boy, the silence that fell in that room,” he recalled recently. “I never will forget it.” Friday, who founded and co-chaired two of the three Knight Foundation sports initiatives over the past 20 years, called Vaccaro “the worst of all” the witnesses ever to come before the panel.', '', 'But what Vaccaro said in 2001 was true then, and it’s true now: corporations offer money so they can profit from the glory of college athletes, and the universities grab it. In 2010, despite the faltering economy, a single college athletic league, the football-crazed Southeastern Conference (SEC), became the first to crack the billion-dollar barrier in athletic receipts. The Big Ten pursued closely at $905 million. That money comes from a combination of ticket sales, concession sales, merchandise, licensing fees, and other sources—but the great bulk of it comes from television contracts.', '', 'Educators are in thrall to their athletic departments because of these television riches and because they respect the political furies that can burst from a locker room. “There’s fear,” Friday told me when I visited him on the University of North Carolina campus in Chapel Hill last fall. As we spoke, two giant construction cranes towered nearby over the university’s Kenan Stadium, working on the latest $77 million renovation. (The University of Michigan spent almost four times that much to expand its Big House.) Friday insisted that for the networks, paying huge sums to universities was a bargain. “We do every little thing for them,” he said. “We furnish the theater, the actors, the lights, the music, and the audience for a drama measured neatly in time slots. They bring the camera and turn it on.” Friday, a weathered idealist at 91, laments the control universities have ceded in pursuit of this money. If television wants to broadcast football from here on a Thursday night, he said, “we shut down the university at 3 o’clock to accommodate the crowds.” He longed for a campus identity more centered in an academic mission.', '', 'The United States is the only country in the world that hosts big-time sports at institutions of higher learning. This should not, in and of itself, be controversial. College athletics are rooted in the classical ideal of mens sane in corpore sano—a sound mind in a sound body—and who would argue with that? College sports are deeply inscribed in the culture of our nation. Half a million young men and women play competitive intercollegiate sports each year. Millions of spectators flock into football stadiums each Saturday in the fall, and tens of millions more watch on television. The March Madness basketball tournament each spring has become a major national event, with upwards of 80 million watching it on television and talking about the games around the office water cooler. ESPN has spawned ESPNU, a channel dedicated to college sports, and Fox Sports and other cable outlets are developing channels exclusively to cover sports from specific regions or divisions.', 'With so many people paying for tickets and watching on television, college sports has become Very Big Business. According to various reports, the football teams at Texas, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, and Penn State—to name just a few big-revenue football schools—each earn between $40 million and $80 million in profits a year, even after paying coaches multimillion-dollar salaries. When you combine so much money with such high, almost tribal, stakes—football boosters are famously rabid in their zeal to have their alma mater win—corruption is likely to follow.', '', 'Scandal after scandal has rocked college sports. In 2010, the NCAA sanctioned the University of Southern California after determining that star running back Reggie Bush and his family had received “improper benefits” while he played for the Trojans. (Among other charges, Bush and members of his family were alleged to have received free airfare and limousine rides, a car, and a rent-free home in San Diego, from sports agents who wanted Bush as a client.) The Bowl Championship Series stripped USC of its 2004 national title, and Bush returned the Heisman Trophy he had won in 2005. Last fall, as Auburn University football stormed its way to an undefeated season and a national championship, the team’s star quarterback, Cam Newton, was dogged by allegations that his father had used a recruiter to solicit up to $180,000 from Mississippi State in exchange for his son’s matriculation there after junior college in 2010. Jim Tressel, the highly successful head football coach of the Ohio State Buckeyes, resigned last spring after the NCAA alleged he had feigned ignorance of rules violations by players on his team. At least 28 players over the course of the previous nine seasons, according to Sports Illustrated, had traded autographs, jerseys, and other team memorabilia in exchange for tattoos or cash at a tattoo parlor in Columbus, in violation of NCAA rules. Late this summer, Yahoo Sports reported that the NCAA was investigating allegations that a University of Miami booster had given millions of dollars in illicit cash and services to more than 70 Hurricanes football players over eight years.', '', 'The list of scandals goes on. With each revelation, there is much wringing of hands. Critics scold schools for breaking faith with their educational mission, and for failing to enforce the sanctity of “amateurism.” Sportswriters denounce the NCAA for both tyranny and impotence in its quest to “clean up” college sports. Observers on all sides express jumbled emotions about youth and innocence, venting against professional mores or greedy amateurs.', 'For all the outrage, the real scandal is not that students are getting illegally paid or recruited, it’s that two of the noble principles on which the NCAA justifies its existence—“amateurism” and the “student-athlete”—are cynical hoaxes, legalistic confections propagated by the universities so they can exploit the skills and fame of young athletes. The tragedy at the heart of college sports is not that some college athletes are getting paid, but that more of them are not.', '', '', 'Don Curtis, a UNC trustee, told me that impoverished football players cannot afford movie tickets or bus fare home. Curtis is a rarity among those in higher education today, in that he dares to violate the signal taboo: “I think we should pay these guys something.”', 'Fans and educators alike recoil from this proposal as though from original sin. Amateurism is the whole point, they say. Paid athletes would destroy the integrity and appeal of college sports. Many former college athletes object that money would have spoiled the sanctity of the bond they enjoyed with their teammates. I, too, once shuddered instinctively at the notion of paid college athletes.', '', 'But after an inquiry that took me into locker rooms and ivory towers across the country, I have come to believe that sentiment blinds us to what’s before our eyes. Big-time college sports are fully commercialized. Billions of dollars flow through them each year. The NCAA makes money, and enables universities and corporations to make money, from the unpaid labor of young athletes.', 'Slavery analogies should be used carefully. College athletes are not slaves. Yet to survey the scene—corporations and universities enriching themselves on the backs of uncompensated young men, whose status as “student-athletes” deprives them of the right to due process guaranteed by the Constitution—is to catch an unmistakable whiff of the plantation. Perhaps a more apt metaphor is colonialism: college sports, as overseen by the NCAA, is a system imposed by well-meaning paternalists and rationalized with hoary sentiments about caring for the well-being of the colonized. But it is, nonetheless, unjust. The NCAA, in its zealous defense of bogus principles, sometimes destroys the dreams of innocent young athletes.', '', 'The NCAA today is in many ways a classic cartel. Efforts to reform it—most notably by the three Knight Commissions over the course of 20 years—have, while making changes around the edges, been largely fruitless. The time has come for a major overhaul. And whether the powers that be like it or not, big changes are coming. Threats loom on multiple fronts: in Congress, the courts, breakaway athletic conferences, student rebellion, and public disgust. Swaddled in gauzy clichés, the NCAA presides over a vast, teetering glory.', 'Founding Myths', 'From the start, amateurism in college sports has been honored more often in principle than in fact; the NCAA was built of a mixture of noble and venal impulses. In the late 19th century, intellectuals believed that the sporting arena simulated an impending age of Darwinian struggle. Because the United States did not hold a global empire like England’s, leaders warned of national softness once railroads conquered the last continental frontier. As though heeding this warning, ingenious students turned variations on rugby into a toughening agent. Today a plaque in New Brunswick, New Jersey, commemorates the first college game, on November 6, 1869, when Rutgers beat Princeton 6–4.', '', 'Walter Camp graduated from Yale in 1880 so intoxicated by the sport that he devoted his life to it without pay, becoming “the father of American football.” He persuaded other schools to reduce the chaos on the field by trimming each side from 15 players to 11, and it was his idea to paint measuring lines on the field. He conceived functional designations for players, coining terms such as quarterback. His game remained violent by design. Crawlers could push the ball forward beneath piles of flying elbows without pause until they cried “Down!” in submission.', '', 'In an 1892 game against its archrival, Yale, the Harvard football team was the first to deploy a “flying wedge,” based on Napoleon’s surprise concentrations of military force. In an editorial calling for the abolition of the play, The New York Times described it as “half a ton of bone and muscle coming into collision with a man weighing 160 or 170 pounds,” noting that surgeons often had to be called onto the field. Three years later, the continuing mayhem prompted the Harvard faculty to take the first of two votes to abolish football. Charles Eliot, the university’s president, brought up other concerns. “Deaths and injuries are not the strongest argument against football,” declared Eliot. “That cheating and brutality are profitable is the main evil.” Still, Harvard football persisted. In 1903, fervent alumni built Harvard Stadium with zero college funds. The team’s first paid head coach, Bill Reid, started in 1905 at nearly twice the average salary for a full professor.', '', 'A newspaper story from that year, illustrated with the Grim Reaper laughing on a goalpost, counted 25 college players killed during football season. A fairy-tale version of the founding of the NCAA holds that President Theodore Roosevelt, upset by a photograph of a bloodied Swarthmore College player, vowed to civilize or destroy football. The real story is that Roosevelt maneuvered shrewdly to preserve the sport—and give a boost to his beloved Harvard. After McClure’s magazine published a story on corrupt teams with phantom students, a muckraker exposed Walter Camp’s $100,000 slush fund at Yale. In response to mounting outrage, Roosevelt summoned leaders from Harvard, Princeton, and Yale to the White House, where Camp parried mounting criticism and conceded nothing irresponsible in the college football rules he’d established. At Roosevelt’s behest, the three schools issued a public statement that college sports must reform to survive, and representatives from 68 colleges founded a new organization that would soon be called the National Collegiate Athletic Association. A Haverford College official was confirmed as secretary but then promptly resigned in favor of Bill Reid, the new Harvard coach, who instituted new rules that benefited Harvard’s playing style at the expense of Yale’s. At a stroke, Roosevelt saved football and dethroned Yale.', '', 'For nearly 50 years, the NCAA, with no real authority and no staff to speak of, enshrined amateur ideals that it was helpless to enforce. (Not until 1939 did it gain the power even to mandate helmets.) In 1929, the Carnegie Foundation made headlines with a report, “American College Athletics,” which concluded that the scramble for players had “reached the proportions of nationwide commerce.” Of the 112 schools surveyed, 81 flouted NCAA recommendations with inducements to students ranging from open payrolls and disguised booster funds to no-show jobs at movie studios. Fans ignored the uproar, and two-thirds of the colleges mentioned told The New York Times that they planned no changes. In 1939, freshman players at the University of Pittsburgh went on strike because they were getting paid less than their upperclassman teammates.', '', 'Embarrassed, the NCAA in 1948 enacted a “Sanity Code,” which was supposed to prohibit all concealed and indirect benefits for college athletes; any money for athletes was to be limited to transparent scholarships awarded solely on financial need. Schools that violated this code would be expelled from NCAA membership and thus exiled from competitive sports.', '', 'This bold effort flopped. Colleges balked at imposing such a drastic penalty on each other, and the Sanity Code was repealed within a few years. The University of Virginia went so far as to call a press conference to say that if its athletes were ever accused of being paid, they should be forgiven, because their studies at Thomas Jefferson’s university were so rigorous.', '', 'The Big Bluff', 'In 1951, the NCAA seized upon a serendipitous set of events to gain control of intercollegiate sports. First, the organization hired a young college dropout named Walter Byers as executive director. A journalist who was not yet 30 years old, he was an appropriately inauspicious choice for the vaguely defined new post. He wore cowboy boots and a toupee. He shunned personal contact, obsessed over details, and proved himself a bureaucratic master of pervasive, anonymous intimidation. Although discharged from the Army during World War II for defective vision, Byers was able to see an opportunity in two contemporaneous scandals. In one, the tiny College of William and Mary, aspiring to challenge football powers Oklahoma and Ohio State, was found to be counterfeiting grades to keep conspicuously pampered players eligible. In the other, a basketball point-shaving conspiracy (in which gamblers paid players to perform poorly) had spread from five New York colleges to the University of Kentucky, the reigning national champion, generating tabloid “perp” photos of gangsters and handcuffed basketball players. The scandals posed a crisis of credibility for collegiate athletics, and nothing in the NCAA’s feeble record would have led anyone to expect real reform.', 'But Byers managed to impanel a small infractions board to set penalties without waiting for a full convention of NCAA schools, which would have been inclined toward forgiveness. Then he lobbied a University of Kentucky dean—A. D. Kirwan, a former football coach and future university president—not to contest the NCAA’s dubious legal position (the association had no actual authority to penalize the university), pleading that college sports must do something to restore public support. His gambit succeeded when Kirwan reluctantly accepted a landmark precedent: the Kentucky basketball team would be suspended for the entire 1952–53 season. Its legendary coach, Adolph Rupp, fumed for a year in limbo.', '', 'The Kentucky case created an aura of centralized command for an NCAA office that barely existed. At the same time, a colossal misperception gave Byers leverage to mine gold. Amazingly in retrospect, most colleges and marketing experts considered the advent of television a dire threat to sports. Studies found that broadcasts reduced live attendance, and therefore gate receipts, because some customers preferred to watch at home for free. Nobody could yet imagine the revenue bonanza that television represented. With clunky new TV sets proliferating, the 1951 NCAA convention voted 161–7 to outlaw televised games except for a specific few licensed by the NCAA staff.', '', 'All but two schools quickly complied. The University of Pennsylvania and Notre Dame protested the order to break contracts for home-game television broadcasts, claiming the right to make their own decisions. Byers objected that such exceptions would invite disaster. The conflict escalated. Byers brandished penalties for games televised without approval. Penn contemplated seeking antitrust protection through the courts. Byers issued a contamination notice, informing any opponent scheduled to play Penn that it would be punished for showing up to compete. In effect, Byers mobilized the college world to isolate the two holdouts in what one sportswriter later called “the Big Bluff.”', '', 'Byers won. Penn folded in part because its president, the perennial White House contender Harold Stassen, wanted to mend relations with fellow schools in the emerging Ivy League, which would be formalized in 1954. When Notre Dame also surrendered, Byers conducted exclusive negotiations with the new television networks on behalf of every college team. Joe Rauh Jr., a prominent civil-rights attorney, helped him devise a rationing system to permit only 11 broadcasts a year—the fabled Game of the Week. Byers and Rauh selected a few teams for television exposure, excluding the rest. On June 6, 1952, NBC signed a one-year deal to pay the NCAA $1.14 million for a carefully restricted football package. Byers routed all contractual proceeds through his office. He floated the idea that, to fund an NCAA infrastructure, his organization should take a 60 percent cut; he accepted 12 percent that season. (For later contracts, as the size of television revenues grew exponentially, he backed down to 5 percent.) Proceeds from the first NBC contract were enough to rent an NCAA headquarters, in Kansas City.', '', 'Only one year into his job, Byers had secured enough power and money to regulate all of college sports. Over the next decade, the NCAA’s power grew along with television revenues. Through the efforts of Byers’s deputy and chief lobbyist, Chuck Neinas, the NCAA won an important concession in the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961, in which Congress made its granting of a precious antitrust exemption to the National Football League contingent upon the blackout of professional football on Saturdays. Deftly, without even mentioning the NCAA, a rider on the bill carved each weekend into protected broadcast markets: Saturday for college, Sunday for the NFL. The NFL got its antitrust exemption. Byers, having negotiated the NCAA’s television package up to $3.1 million per football season—which was higher than the NFL’s figure in those early years—had made the NCAA into a spectacularly profitable cartel.', '', '“We Eat What We Kill”', 'The NCAA’s control of college sports still rested on a fragile base, however: the consent of the colleges and universities it governed. For a time, the vast sums of television money delivered to these institutions through Byers’s deals made them willing to submit. But the big football powers grumbled about the portion of the television revenue diverted to nearly a thousand NCAA member schools that lacked major athletic programs. They chafed against cost-cutting measures—such as restrictions on team size—designed to help smaller schools. “I don’t want Hofstra telling Texas how to play football,” Darrell Royal, the Longhorns coach, griped. By the 1970s and ’80s, as college football games delivered bonanza ratings—and advertising revenue—to the networks, some of the big football schools began to wonder: Why do we need to have our television coverage brokered through the NCAA? Couldn’t we get a bigger cut of that TV money by dealing directly with the networks?', '', 'Byers faced a rude internal revolt. The NCAA’s strongest legions, its big football schools, defected en masse. Calling the NCAA a price-fixing cartel that siphoned every television dollar through its coffers, in 1981 a rogue consortium of 61 major football schools threatened to sign an independent contract with NBC for $180 million over four years.', '', 'With a huge chunk of the NCAA’s treasury walking out the door, Byers threatened sanctions, as he had against Penn and Notre Dame three decades earlier. But this time the universities of Georgia and Oklahoma responded with an antitrust suit. “It is virtually impossible to overstate the degree of our resentment … of the NCAA,” said William Banowsky, the president of the University of Oklahoma. In the landmark 1984 NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma decision, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the NCAA’s latest football contracts with television—and any future ones—as an illegal restraint of trade that harmed colleges and viewers. Overnight, the NCAA’s control of the television market for football vanished. Upholding Banowsky’s challenge to the NCAA’s authority, the Regents decision freed the football schools to sell any and all games the markets would bear. Coaches and administrators no longer had to share the revenue generated by their athletes with smaller schools outside the football consortium. “We eat what we kill,” one official at the University of Texas bragged.', '', 'A few years earlier, this blow might have financially crippled the NCAA—but a rising tide of money from basketball concealed the structural damage of the Regents decision. During the 1980s, income from the March Madness college basketball tournament, paid directly by the television networks to the NCAA, grew tenfold. The windfall covered—and then far exceeded—what the organization had lost from football.', '', 'Still, Byers never forgave his former deputy Chuck Neinas for leading the rebel consortium. He knew that Neinas had seen from the inside how tenuous the NCAA’s control really was, and how diligently Byers had worked to prop up its Oz-like façade. During Byers’s tenure, the rule book for Division I athletes grew to 427 pages of scholastic detail. His NCAA personnel manual banned conversations around water coolers, and coffee cups on desks, while specifying exactly when drapes must be drawn at the NCAA’s 27,000-square-foot headquarters near Kansas City (built in 1973 from the proceeds of a 1 percent surtax on football contracts). It was as though, having lost control where it mattered, Byers pedantically exerted more control where it didn’t.', '', 'After retiring in 1987, Byers let slip his suppressed fury that the ingrate football conferences, having robbed the NCAA of television revenue, still expected it to enforce amateurism rules and police every leak of funds to college players. A lethal greed was “gnawing at the innards of college athletics,” he wrote in his memoir. When Byers renounced the NCAA’s pretense of amateurism, his former colleagues would stare blankly, as though he had gone senile or, as he wrote, “desecrated my sacred vows.” But Byers was better positioned than anyone else to argue that college football’s claim to amateurism was unfounded. Years later, as we will see, lawyers would seize upon his words to do battle with the NCAA.', '', 'Meanwhile, reformers fretted that commercialism was hurting college sports, and that higher education’s historical balance between academics and athletics had been distorted by all the money sloshing around. News stories revealed that schools went to extraordinary measures to keep academically incompetent athletes eligible for competition, and would vie for the most-sought-after high-school players by proffering under-the-table payments. In 1991, the first Knight Commission report, “Keeping Faith With the Student Athlete,” was published; the commission’s “bedrock conviction” was that university presidents must seize control of the NCAA from athletic directors in order to restore the preeminence of academic values over athletic or commercial ones. In response, college presidents did take over the NCAA’s governance. But by 2001, when the second Knight Commission report (“A Call to Action: Reconnecting College Sports and Higher Education”) was issued, a new generation of reformers was admitting that problems of corruption and commercialism had “grown rather than diminished” since the first report. Meanwhile the NCAA itself, revenues rising, had moved into a $50 million, 116,000-square-foot headquarters in Indianapolis. By 2010, as the size of NCAA headquarters increased yet again with a 130,000-square-foot expansion, a third Knight Commission was groping blindly for a hold on independent college-athletic conferences that were behaving more like sovereign pro leagues than confederations of universities. And still more money continued to flow into NCAA coffers. With the basketball tournament’s 2011 television deal, annual March Madness broadcast revenues had skyrocketed 50-fold in less than 30 years.', '', 'The Myth of the “Student-Athlete”', 'Today, much of the NCAA’s moral authority—indeed much of the justification for its existence—is vested in its claim to protect what it calls the “student-athlete.” The term is meant to conjure the nobility of amateurism, and the precedence of scholarship over athletic endeavor. But the origins of the “student-athlete” lie not in a disinterested ideal but in a sophistic formulation designed, as the sports economist Andrew Zimbalist has written, to help the NCAA in its “fight against workmen’s compensation insurance claims for injured football players.”', '“We crafted the term student-athlete,” Walter Byers himself wrote, “and soon it was embedded in all NCAA rules and interpretations.” The term came into play in the 1950s, when the widow of Ray Dennison, who had died from a head injury received while playing football in Colorado for the Fort Lewis A&M Aggies, filed for workmen’s-compensation death benefits. Did his football scholarship make the fatal collision a “work-related” accident? Was he a school employee, like his peers who worked part-time as teaching assistants and bookstore cashiers? Or was he a fluke victim of extracurricular pursuits? Given the hundreds of incapacitating injuries to college athletes each year, the answers to these questions had enormous consequences. The Colorado Supreme Court ultimately agreed with the school’s contention that he was not eligible for benefits, since the college was “not in the football business.”', '', 'The term student-athlete was deliberately ambiguous. College players were not students at play (which might understate their athletic obligations), nor were they just athletes in college (which might imply they were professionals). That they were high-performance athletes meant they could be forgiven for not meeting the academic standards of their peers; that they were students meant they did not have to be compensated, ever, for anything more than the cost of their studies. Student-athlete became the NCAA’s signature term, repeated constantly in and out of courtrooms.', '', 'Using the “student-athlete” defense, colleges have compiled a string of victories in liability cases. On the afternoon of October 26, 1974, the Texas Christian University Horned Frogs were playing the Alabama Crimson Tide in Birmingham, Alabama. Kent Waldrep, a TCU running back, carried the ball on a “Red Right 28” sweep toward the Crimson Tide’s sideline, where he was met by a swarm of tacklers. When Waldrep regained consciousness, Bear Bryant, the storied Crimson Tide coach, was standing over his hospital bed. “It was like talking to God, if you’re a young football player,” Waldrep recalled.', '', 'Waldrep was paralyzed: he had lost all movement and feeling below his neck. After nine months of paying his medical bills, Texas Christian refused to pay any more, so the Waldrep family coped for years on dwindling charity.', '', 'Through the 1990s, from his wheelchair, Waldrep pressed a lawsuit for workers’ compensation. (He also, through heroic rehabilitation efforts, recovered feeling in his arms, and eventually learned to drive a specially rigged van. “I can brush my teeth,” he told me last year, “but I still need help to bathe and dress.”) His attorneys haggled with TCU and the state worker-compensation fund over what constituted employment. Clearly, TCU had provided football players with equipment for the job, as a typical employer would—but did the university pay wages, withhold income taxes on his financial aid, or control work conditions and performance? The appeals court finally rejected Waldrep’s claim in June of 2000, ruling that he was not an employee because he had not paid taxes on financial aid that he could have kept even if he quit football. (Waldrep told me school officials “said they recruited me as a student, not an athlete,” which he says was absurd.)', '', 'The long saga vindicated the power of the NCAA’s “student-athlete” formulation as a shield, and the organization continues to invoke it as both a legalistic defense and a noble ideal. Indeed, such is the term’s rhetorical power that it is increasingly used as a sort of reflexive mantra against charges of rabid hypocrisy.', '', 'Last Thanksgiving weekend, with both the FBI and the NCAA investigating whether Cam Newton had been lured onto his team with illegal payments, Newton’s Auburn Tigers and the Alabama Crimson Tide came together for their annual game, known as the Iron Bowl, before 101,821 fans at Bryant-Denny Stadium. This game is always a highlight of the football season because of the historic rivalry between the two schools, and the 2010 edition had enormous significance, pitting the defending national champion Crimson Tide against the undefeated Tigers, who were aiming for their first championship since 1957. I expected excited fans; what I encountered was the throbbing heart of college sports. As I drove before daybreak toward the stadium, a sleepless caller babbled over WJOX, the local fan radio station, that he “couldn’t stop thinking about the coin toss.” In the parking lot, ticketless fans were puzzled that anyone need ask why they had tailgated for days just to watch their satellite-fed flat screens within earshot of the roar. All that morning, pilgrims packed the Bear Bryant museum, where displays elaborated the misery of Alabama’s 4–24 run before the glorious Bryant era dawned in 1958.', '', 'Finally, as Auburn took the field for warm-ups, one of Alabama’s public-address-system operators played “Take the Money and Run” (an act for which he would be fired). A sea of signs reading $CAM taunted Newton. The game, perhaps the most exciting of the season, was unbearably tense, with Auburn coming from way behind to win 28–27, all but assuring that it would go on to play for the national championship. Days later, Auburn suspended Newton after the NCAA found that a rules violation had occurred: his father was alleged to have marketed his son in a pay-for-play scheme; a day after that, the NCAA reinstated Newton’s eligibility because investigators had not found evidence that Newton or Auburn officials had known of his father’s actions. This left Newton conveniently eligible for the Southeastern Conference championship game and for the postseason BCS championship bowl. For the NCAA, prudence meant honoring public demand.', '', '“Our championships,” NCAA President Mark Emmert has declared, “are one of the primary tools we have to enhance the student-athlete experience.”', '', '“Whoremasters”', 'NCAA v. Regents left the NCAA devoid of television football revenue and almost wholly dependent on March Madness basketball. It is rich but insecure. Last year, CBS Sports and Turner Broadcasting paid $771 million to the NCAA for television rights to the 2011 men’s basketball tournament alone. That’s three-quarters of a billion dollars built on the backs of amateurs—on unpaid labor. The whole edifice depends on the players’ willingness to perform what is effectively volunteer work. The athletes, and the league officials, are acutely aware of this extraordinary arrangement. William Friday, the former North Carolina president, recalls being yanked from one Knight Commission meeting and sworn to secrecy about what might happen if a certain team made the NCAA championship basketball game. “They were going to dress and go out on the floor,” Friday told me, “but refuse to play,” in a wildcat student strike. Skeptics doubted such a diabolical plot. These were college kids—unlikely to second-guess their coaches, let alone forfeit the dream of a championship. Still, it was unnerving to contemplate what hung on the consent of a few young volunteers: several hundred million dollars in television revenue, countless livelihoods, the NCAA budget, and subsidies for sports at more than 1,000 schools. Friday’s informants exhaled when the suspect team lost before the finals.', '', 'Cognizant of its precarious financial base, the NCAA has in recent years begun to pursue new sources of revenue. Taking its cue from member schools such as Ohio State (which in 2009 bundled all its promotional rights—souvenirs, stadium ads, shoe deals—and outsourced them to the international sports marketer IMG College for a guaranteed $11 million a year), the NCAA began to exploit its vault of college sports on film. For $29.99 apiece, NCAA On Demand offers DVDs of more than 200 memorable contests in men’s ice hockey alone. Video-game technology also allows nostalgic fans to relive and even participate in classic moments of NCAA Basketball. NCAA Football, licensed by the NCAA through IMG College to Electronic Arts, one of the world’s largest video-game manufacturers, reportedly sold 2.5 million copies in 2008. Brit Kirwan, the chancellor of the Maryland university system and a former president at Ohio State, says there were “terrible fights” between the third Knight Commission and the NCAA over the ethics of generating this revenue.', '', 'All of this money ultimately derives from the college athletes whose likenesses are shown in the films or video games. But none of the profits go to them. Last year, Electronic Arts paid more than $35 million in royalties to the NFL players union for the underlying value of names and images in its pro football series—but neither the NCAA nor its affiliated companies paid former college players a nickel. Naturally, as they have become more of a profit center for the NCAA, some of the vaunted “student-athletes” have begun to clamor that they deserve a share of those profits. You “see everybody getting richer and richer,” Desmond Howard, who won the 1991 Heisman Trophy while playing for the Michigan Wolverines, told USA Today recently. “And you walk around and you can’t put gas in your car? You can’t even fly home to see your parents?”', '', 'Some athletes have gone beyond talk. A series of lawsuits quietly making their way through the courts cast a harsh light on the absurdity of the system—and threaten to dislodge the foundations on which the NCAA rests. On July 21, 2009, lawyers for Ed O’Bannon filed a class-action antitrust suit against the NCAA at the U.S. District Court in San Francisco. “Once you leave your university,” says O’Bannon, who won the John Wooden Award for player of the year in 1995 on UCLA’s national-championship basketball team, “one would think your likeness belongs to you.” The NCAA and UCLA continue to collect money from the sales of videos of him playing. But by NCAA rules, O’Bannon, who today works at a Toyota dealership near Las Vegas, alleges he is still not allowed to share the revenue the NCAA generates from his own image as a college athlete. His suit quickly gathered co-plaintiffs from basketball and football, ex-players featured in NCAA videos and other products. “The NCAA does not license student-athlete likenesses,” NCAA spokesperson Erik Christianson told The New York Times in response to the suit, “or prevent former student-athletes from attempting to do so. Likewise, to claim the NCAA profits off student-athlete likenesses is also pure fiction.”', '', 'The legal contention centers on Part IV of the NCAA’s “Student-Athlete Statement” for Division I, which requires every athlete to authorize use of “your name or picture … to promote NCAA championships or other NCAA events, activities or programs.” Does this clause mean that athletes clearly renounce personal interest forever? If so, does it actually undermine the NCAA by implicitly recognizing that athletes have a property right in their own performance? Jon King, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, expects the NCAA’s core mission of amateurism to be its “last defense standing.”', '', 'In theory, the NCAA’s passion to protect the noble amateurism of college athletes should prompt it to focus on head coaches in the high-revenue sports—basketball and football—since holding the top official accountable should most efficiently discourage corruption. The problem is that the coaches’ growing power has rendered them, unlike their players, ever more immune to oversight. According to research by Charles Clotfelter, an economist at Duke, the average compensation for head football coaches at public universities, now more than $2 million, has grown 750 percent (adjusted for inflation) since the Regents decision in 1984; that’s more than 20 times the cumulative 32 percent raise for college professors. For top basketball coaches, annual contracts now exceed $4 million, augmented by assorted bonuses, endorsements, country-club memberships, the occasional private plane, and in some cases a negotiated percentage of ticket receipts. (Oregon’s ticket concessions netted former football coach Mike Bellotti an additional $631,000 in 2005.)', '', 'The NCAA rarely tangles with such people, who are apt to fight back and win. When Rick Neuheisel, the head football coach of the Washington Huskies, was punished for petty gambling (in a March Madness pool, as it happened), he sued the NCAA and the university for wrongful termination, collected $4.5 million, and later moved on to UCLA. When the NCAA tried to cap assistant coaches’ entering salary at a mere $16,000, nearly 2,000 of them brought an antitrust suit, Law v. NCAA, and in 1999 settled for $54.5 million. Since then, salaries for assistant coaches have commonly exceeded $200,000, with the top assistants in the SEC averaging $700,000. In 2009, Monte Kiffin, then at the University of Tennessee, became the first assistant coach to reach $1 million, plus benefits.', '', 'The late Myles Brand, who led the NCAA from 2003 to 2009, defended the economics of college sports by claiming that they were simply the result of a smoothly functioning free market. He and his colleagues deflected criticism about the money saturating big-time college sports by focusing attention on scapegoats; in 2010, outrage targeted sports agents. Last year Sports Illustrated published “Confessions of an Agent,” a firsthand account of dealing with high-strung future pros whom the agent and his peers courted with flattery, cash, and tawdry favors. Nick Saban, Alabama’s head football coach, mobilized his peers to denounce agents as a public scourge. “I hate to say this,” he said, “but how are they any better than a pimp? I have no respect for people who do that to young people. None.”', '', 'Saban’s raw condescension contrasts sharply with the lonely penitence from Dale Brown, the retired longtime basketball coach at LSU. “Look at the money we make off predominantly poor black kids,” Brown once reflected. “We’re the whoremasters.”', '', '“Picayune Rules”', 'NCAA officials have tried to assert their dominion—and distract attention from the larger issues—by chasing frantically after petty violations. Tom McMillen, a former member of the Knight Commission who was an All-American basketball player at the University of Maryland, likens these officials to traffic cops in a speed trap, who could flag down almost any passing motorist for prosecution in kangaroo court under a “maze of picayune rules.” The publicized cases have become convoluted soap operas. At the start of the 2010 football season, A. J. Green, a wide receiver at Georgia, confessed that he’d sold his own jersey from the Independence Bowl the year before, to raise cash for a spring-break vacation. The NCAA sentenced Green to a four-game suspension for violating his amateur status with the illicit profit generated by selling the shirt off his own back. While he served the suspension, the Georgia Bulldogs store continued legally selling replicas of Green’s No. 8 jersey for $39.95 and up.', '', 'A few months later, the NCAA investigated rumors that Ohio State football players had benefited from “hook-ups on tatts”—that is, that they’d gotten free or underpriced tattoos at an Ohio tattoo parlor in exchange for autographs and memorabilia—a violation of the NCAA’s rule against discounts linked to athletic personae. The NCAA Committee on Infractions imposed five-game suspensions on Terrelle Pryor, Ohio State’s tattooed quarterback, and four other players (some of whom had been found to have sold their Big Ten championship rings and other gear), but did permit them to finish the season and play in the Sugar Bowl. (This summer, in an attempt to satisfy NCAA investigators, Ohio State voluntarily vacated its football wins from last season, as well as its Sugar Bowl victory.) A different NCAA committee promulgated a rule banning symbols and messages in players’ eyeblack—reportedly aimed at Pryor’s controversial gesture of support for the pro quarterback Michael Vick, and at Bible verses inscribed in the eyeblack of the former Florida quarterback Tim Tebow.', '', 'The moral logic is hard to fathom: the NCAA bans personal messages on the bodies of the players, and penalizes players for trading their celebrity status for discounted tattoos—but it codifies precisely how and where commercial insignia from multinational corporations can be displayed on college players, for the financial benefit of the colleges. Last season, while the NCAA investigated him and his father for the recruiting fees they’d allegedly sought, Cam Newton compliantly wore at least 15 corporate logos—one on his jersey, four on his helmet visor, one on each wristband, one on his pants, six on his shoes, and one on the headband he wears under his helmet—as part of Auburn’s $10.6 million deal with Under Armour.', '', '“Restitution”', 'Obscure NCAA rules have bedeviled Scott Boras, the preeminent sports agent for Major League Baseball stars, in cases that may ultimately prove more threatening to the NCAA than Ed O’Bannon’s antitrust suit. In 2008, Andrew Oliver, a sophomore pitcher for the Oklahoma State Cowboys, had been listed as the 12th-best professional prospect among sophomore players nationally. He decided to dismiss the two attorneys who had represented him out of high school, Robert and Tim Baratta, and retain Boras instead. Infuriated, the Barattas sent a spiteful letter to the NCAA. Oliver didn’t learn about this until the night before he was scheduled to pitch in the regional final for a place in the College World Series, when an NCAA investigator showed up to question him in the presence of lawyers for Oklahoma State. The investigator also questioned his father, Dave, a truck driver.', '', 'Had Tim Baratta been present in their home when the Minnesota Twins offered $390,000 for Oliver to sign out of high school? A yes would mean trouble. While the NCAA did not forbid all professional advice—indeed, Baseball America used to publish the names of agents representing draft-likely underclassmen—NCAA Bylaw 12.3.2.1 prohibited actual negotiation with any professional team by an adviser, on pain of disqualification for the college athlete. The questioning lasted past midnight.', '', 'Just hours before the game was to start the next day, Oklahoma State officials summoned Oliver to tell him he would not be pitching. Only later did he learn that the university feared that by letting him play while the NCAA adjudicated his case, the university would open not only the baseball team but all other Oklahoma State teams to broad punishment under the NCAA’s “restitution rule” (Bylaw 19.7), under which the NCAA threatens schools with sanctions if they obey any temporary court order benefiting a college athlete, should that order eventually be modified or removed. The baseball coach did not even let his ace tell his teammates the sad news in person. “He said, ‘It’s probably not a good idea for you to be at the game,’” Oliver recalls.', '', 'The Olivers went home to Ohio to find a lawyer. Rick Johnson, a solo practitioner specializing in legal ethics, was aghast that the Baratta brothers had turned in their own client to the NCAA, divulging attorney-client details likely to invite wrath upon Oliver. But for the next 15 months, Johnson directed his litigation against the two NCAA bylaws at issue. Judge Tygh M. Tone, of Erie County, came to share his outrage. On February 12, 2009, Tone struck down the ban on lawyers negotiating for student-athletes as a capricious, exploitative attempt by a private association to “dictate to an attorney where, what, how, or when he should represent his client,” violating accepted legal practice in every state. He also struck down the NCAA’s restitution rule as an intimidation that attempted to supersede the judicial system. Finally, Judge Tone ordered the NCAA to reinstate Oliver’s eligibility at Oklahoma State for his junior season, which started several days later.', '', 'The NCAA sought to disqualify Oliver again, with several appellate motions to stay “an unprecedented Order purporting to void a fundamental Bylaw.” Oliver did get to pitch that season, but he dropped into the second round of the June 2009 draft, signing for considerably less than if he’d been picked earlier. Now 23, Oliver says sadly that the whole experience “made me grow up a little quicker.” His lawyer claimed victory. “Andy Oliver is the first college athlete ever to win against the NCAA in court,” said Rick Johnson.', '', 'Yet the victory was only temporary. Wounded, the NCAA fought back with a vengeance. Its battery of lawyers prepared for a damages trial, ultimately overwhelming Oliver’s side eight months later with an offer to resolve the dispute for $750,000. When Oliver and Johnson accepted, to extricate themselves ahead of burgeoning legal costs, Judge Tone was compelled to vacate his orders as part of the final settlement. This freed NCAA officials to reassert the two bylaws that Judge Tone had so forcefully overturned, and they moved swiftly to ramp up rather than curtail enforcement. First, the NCAA’s Eligibility Center devised a survey for every drafted undergraduate athlete who sought to stay in college another year. The survey asked whether an agent had conducted negotiations. It also requested a signed release waiving privacy rights and authorizing professional teams to disclose details of any interaction to the NCAA Eligibility Center. Second, NCAA enforcement officials went after another Scott Boras client.', '', 'The Toronto Blue Jays had made the left-handed pitcher James Paxton, of the University of Kentucky, the 37th pick in the 2009 draft. Paxton decided to reject a reported $1 million offer and return to school for his senior year, pursuing a dream to pitch for his team in the College World Series. But then he ran into the new NCAA survey. Had Boras negotiated with the Blue Jays? Boras has denied that he did, but it would have made sense that he had—that was his job, to test the market for his client. But saying so would get Paxton banished under the same NCAA bylaw that had derailed Andrew Oliver’s career. Since Paxton was planning to go back to school and not accept their draft offer, the Blue Jays no longer had any incentive to protect him—indeed, they had every incentive to turn him in. The Blue Jays’ president, by telling reporters that Boras had negotiated on Paxton’s behalf, demonstrated to future recruits and other teams that they could use the NCAA’s rules to punish college players who wasted their draft picks by returning to college. The NCAA’s enforcement staff raised the pressure by requesting to interview Paxton.', '', 'Though Paxton had no legal obligation to talk to an investigator, NCAA Bylaw 10.1(j) specified that anything short of complete cooperation could be interpreted as unethical conduct, affecting his amateur status. Under its restitution rule, the NCAA had leverage to compel the University of Kentucky to ensure obedience.', '', 'As the 2010 season approached, Gary Henderson, the Kentucky coach, sorely wanted Paxton, one of Baseball America’s top-ranked players, to return. Rick Johnson, Andrew Oliver’s lawyer, filed for a declaratory judgment on Paxton’s behalf, arguing that the state constitution—plus the university’s code of student conduct—barred arbitrary discipline at the request of a third party. Kentucky courts deferred to the university, however, and Paxton was suspended from the team. “Due to the possibility of future penalties, including forfeiture of games,” the university stated, it “could not put the other 32 players of the team and the entire UK 22-sport intercollegiate athletics department at risk by having James compete.” The NCAA appraised the result with satisfaction. “When negotiations occur on behalf of student-athletes,” Erik Christianson, the NCAA spokesperson, told The New York Times in reference to the Oliver case, “those negotiations indicate that the student-athlete intends to become a professional athlete and no longer remain an amateur.”', '', 'Paxton was stranded. Not only could he not play for Kentucky, but his draft rights with the Blue Jays had lapsed for the year, meaning he could not play for any minor-league affiliate of Major League Baseball. Boras wrangled a holdover job for him in Texas with the independent Grand Prairie AirHogs, pitching against the Pensacola Pelicans and Wichita Wingnuts. Once projected to be a first-round draft pick, Paxton saw his stock plummet into the fourth round. He remained unsigned until late in spring training, when he signed with the Seattle Mariners and reported to their minor-league camp in Peoria, Arizona.', '', '“You Might As Well Shoot Them in the Head”', '“When you dream about playing in college,” Joseph Agnew told me not long ago, “you don’t ever think about being in a lawsuit.” Agnew, a student at Rice University in Houston, had been cut from the football team and had his scholarship revoked by Rice before his senior year, meaning that he faced at least $35,000 in tuition and other bills if he wanted to complete his degree in sociology. Bereft of his scholarship, he was flailing about for help when he discovered the National College Players Association, which claims 7,000 active members and seeks modest reforms such as safety guidelines and better death benefits for college athletes. Agnew was struck by the NCPA scholarship data on players from top Division I basketball teams, which showed that 22 percent were not renewed from 2008 to 2009—the same fate he had suffered.', '', 'In October 2010, Agnew filed a class-action antitrust suit over the cancellation of his scholarship and to remove the cap on the total number of scholarships that can be awarded by NCAA schools. In his suit, Agnew did not claim the right to free tuition. He merely asked the federal court to strike down an NCAA rule, dating to 1973, that prohibited colleges and universities from offering any athletic scholarship longer than a one-year commitment, to be renewed or not, unilaterally, by the school—which in practice means that coaches get to decide each year whose scholarships to renew or cancel. (After the coach who had recruited Agnew had moved on to Tulsa, the new Rice coach switched Agnew’s scholarship to a recruit of his own.) Agnew argued that without the one-year rule, he would have been free to bargain with all eight colleges that had recruited him, and each college could have decided how long to guarantee his scholarship.', '', 'Agnew’s suit rested on a claim of an NCAA antitrust violation combined with a laudable academic goal—making it possible for students to finish their educations. Around the same time, lawyers from President Obama’s Justice Department initiated a series of meetings with NCAA officials and universities in which they asked what possible educational rationale there was for allowing the NCAA—an organization that did not itself pay for scholarships—to impose a blanket restriction on the length of scholarships offered by colleges. Tidbits leaked into the press. In response, the NCAA contended that an athletic scholarship was a “merit award” that should be reviewed annually, presumably because the degree of “merit” could change. Justice Department lawyers reportedly suggested that a free market in scholarships would expand learning opportunities in accord with the stated rationale for the NCAA’s tax-exempt status—that it promotes education through athletics. The one-year rule effectively allows colleges to cut underperforming “student-athletes,” just as pro sports teams cut their players. “Plenty of them don’t stay in school,” said one of Agnew’s lawyers, Stuart Paynter. “They’re just gone. You might as well shoot them in the head.”', '', 'Agnew’s lawsuit has made him a pariah to former friends in the athletic department at Rice, where everyone identified so thoroughly with the NCAA that they seemed to feel he was attacking them personally. But if the premise of Agnew’s case is upheld by the courts, it will make a sham of the NCAA’s claim that its highest priority is protecting education.', '', '“They Want to Crush These Kids”', 'Academic performance has always been difficult for the NCAA to address. Any detailed regulation would intrude upon the free choice of widely varying schools, and any academic standard broad enough to fit both MIT and Ole Miss would have little force. From time to time, a scandal will expose extreme lapses. In 1989, Dexter Manley, by then the famous “Secretary of Defense” for the NFL’s Washington Redskins, teared up before the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Education, Arts, and Humanities, when admitting that he had been functionally illiterate in college.', '', 'Within big-time college athletic departments, the financial pressure to disregard obvious academic shortcomings and shortcuts is just too strong. In the 1980s, Jan Kemp, an English instructor at the University of Georgia, publicly alleged that university officials had demoted and then fired her because she refused to inflate grades in her remedial English courses. Documents showed that administrators replaced the grades she’d given athletes with higher ones, providing fake passing grades on one notable occasion to nine Bulldog football players who otherwise would have been ineligible to compete in the 1982 Sugar Bowl. (Georgia lost anyway, 24–20, to a University of Pittsburgh team led by the future Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino.) When Kemp filed a lawsuit against the university, she was publicly vilified as a troublemaker, but she persisted bravely in her testimony. Once, Kemp said, a supervisor demanding that she fix a grade had bellowed, “Who do you think is more important to this university, you or Dominique Wilkins?” (Wilkins was a star on the basketball team.) Traumatized, Kemp twice attempted suicide.', '', 'In trying to defend themselves, Georgia officials portrayed Kemp as naive about sports. “We have to compete on a level playing field,” said Fred Davison, the university president. During the Kemp civil trial, in 1986, Hale Almand, Georgia’s defense lawyer, explained the university’s patronizing aspirations for its typical less-than-scholarly athlete. “We may not make a university student out of him,” Almand told the court, “but if we can teach him to read and write, maybe he can work at the post office rather than as a garbage man when he gets through with his athletic career.” This argument backfired with the jurors: finding in favor of Kemp, they rejected her polite request for $100,000, and awarded her $2.6 million in damages instead. (This was later reduced to $1.08 million.) Jan Kemp embodied what is ostensibly the NCAA’s reason for being—to enforce standards fairly and put studies above sports—but no one from the organization ever spoke up on her behalf.', '', 'THE NCAA BODY charged with identifying violations of any of the Division I league rules, the Committee on Infractions, operates in the shadows. Josephine Potuto, a professor of law at the University of Nebraska and a longtime committee member who was then serving as its vice chair, told Congress in 2004 that one reason her group worked in secret was that it hoped to avoid a “media circus.” The committee preferred to deliberate in private, she said, guiding member schools to punish themselves. “The enforcement process is cooperative, not adversarial,” Potuto testified. The committee consisted of an elite coterie of judges, athletic directors, and authors of legal treatises. “The committee also is savvy about intercollegiate athletics,” she added. “They cannot be conned.”', '', 'In 2009, a series of unlikely circumstances peeled back the veil of secrecy to reveal NCAA procedures so contorted that even victims marveled at their comical wonder. The saga began in March of 2007, shortly after the Florida State Seminoles basketball team was knocked out of the NIT basketball tournament, which each spring invites the best teams not selected for the March Madness tournament. At an athletic-department study hall, Al Thornton, a star forward for the team, completed a sports-psychology quiz but then abandoned it without posting his written answers electronically by computer. Brenda Monk, an academic tutor for the Seminoles, says she noticed the error and asked a teammate to finish entering Thornton’s answers onscreen and hit “submit,” as required for credit. The teammate complied, steaming silently, and then complained at the athletic office about getting stuck with clean-up chores for the superstar Thornton (who was soon to be selected by the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round of the NBA draft). Monk promptly resigned when questioned by FSU officials, saying her fatigue at the time could not excuse her asking the teammate to submit the answers to another student’s completed test.', '', 'Monk’s act of guileless responsibility set off a chain reaction. First, FSU had to give the NCAA preliminary notice of a confessed academic fraud. Second, because this would be its seventh major infraction case since 1968, FSU mounted a vigorous self-investigation to demonstrate compliance with NCAA academic rules. Third, interviews with 129 Seminoles athletes unleashed a nightmare of matter-of-fact replies about absentee professors who allowed group consultations and unlimited retakes of open-computer assignments and tests. Fourth, FSU suspended 61 of its athletes in 10 sports. Fifth, the infractions committee applied the byzantine NCAA bylaws to FSU’s violations. Sixth, one of the penalties announced in March of 2009 caused a howl of protest across the sports universe.', '', 'Twenty-seven news organizations filed a lawsuit in hopes of finding out how and why the NCAA proposed to invalidate 14 prior victories in FSU football. Such a penalty, if upheld, would doom coach Bobby Bowden’s chance of overtaking Joe Paterno of Penn State for the most football wins in Division I history. This was sacrosanct territory. Sports reporters followed the litigation for six months, reporting that 25 of the 61 suspended FSU athletes were football players, some of whom were ruled ineligible retroactively from the time they had heard or yelled out answers to online test questions in, of all things, a music-appreciation course.', '', 'When reporters sought access to the transcript of the infractions committee’s hearing in Indianapolis, NCAA lawyers said the 695-page document was private. (The NCAA claimed it was entitled to keep all such records secret because of a landmark Supreme Court ruling that it had won in 1988, in NCAA v. Tarkanian, which exempted the organization from any due-process obligations because it was not a government organization.) Media outlets pressed the judge to let Florida State share its own copy of the hearing transcript, whereupon NCAA lawyers objected that the school had never actually “possessed” the document; it had only seen the transcript via a defendant’s guest access to the carefully restricted NCAA Web site. This claim, in turn, prompted intercession on the side of the media by Florida’s attorney general, arguing that letting the NCAA use a technical loophole like this would undermine the state’s sunshine law mandating open public records. After tumultuous appeals, the Florida courts agreed and ordered the NCAA transcript released in October of 2009.', '', 'News interest quickly evaporated when the sports media found nothing in the record about Coach Bowden or the canceled football victories. But the transcript revealed plenty about the NCAA. On page 37, T. K. Wetherell, the bewildered Florida State president, lamented that his university had hurt itself by cooperating with the investigation. “We self-reported this case,” he said during the hearing, and he later complained that the most ingenuous athletes—those who asked “What’s the big deal, this happens all the time?”—received the harshest suspensions, while those who clammed up on the advice of lawyers went free. The music-appreciation professor was apparently never questioned. Brenda Monk, the only instructor who consistently cooperated with the investigation, appeared voluntarily to explain her work with learning-disabled athletes, only to be grilled about her credentials by Potuto in a pettifogging inquisition of remarkable stamina.', '', 'In January of last year, the NCAA’s Infractions Appeals Committee sustained all the sanctions imposed on FSU except the number of vacated football victories, which it dropped, ex cathedra, from 14 to 12. The final penalty locked Bobby Bowden’s official win total on retirement at 377 instead of 389, behind Joe Paterno’s 401 (and counting). This carried stinging symbolism for fans, without bringing down on the NCAA the harsh repercussions it would have risked if it had issued a television ban or substantial fine.', '', 'Cruelly, but typically, the NCAA concentrated public censure on powerless scapegoats. A dreaded “show cause” order rendered Brenda Monk, the tutor, effectively unhirable at any college in the United States. Cloaking an old-fashioned blackball in the stately language of law, the order gave notice that any school hiring Monk before a specified date in 2013 “shall, pursuant to the provisions of Bylaw 19.5.2.2(l), show cause why it should not be penalized if it does not restrict the former learning specialist [Monk] from having any contact with student-athletes.” Today she works as an education supervisor at a prison in Florida.', '', 'THE FLORIDA STATE verdict hardly surprised Rick Johnson, the lawyer who had represented the college pitchers Andrew Oliver and James Paxton. “All the NCAA’s enforcements are random and selective,” he told me, calling the organization’s appeals process a travesty. (Johnson says the NCAA has never admitted to having wrongly suspended an athlete.) Johnson’s scalding experience prompted him to undertake a law-review article on the subject, which in turn sent him trawling through NCAA archives. From the summary tax forms required of nonprofits, he found out that the NCAA had spent nearly $1 million chartering private jets in 2006. “What kind of nonprofit organization leases private jets?,” Johnson asks. It’s hard to determine from tax returns what money goes where, but it looks as if the NCAA spent less than 1 percent of its budget on enforcement that year. Even after its plump cut for its own overhead, the NCAA dispersed huge sums to its 1,200 member schools, in the manner of a professional sports league. These annual payments are universal—every college gets something—but widely uneven. They keep the disparate shareholders (barely) united and speaking for all of college sports. The payments coerce unity within the structure of a private association that is unincorporated and unregulated, exercising amorphous powers not delegated by any government.', '', 'Searching through the archives, Johnson came across a 1973 memo from the NCAA general counsel recommending the adoption of a due-process procedure for athletes in disciplinary cases. Without it, warned the organization’s lawyer, the association risked big liability claims for deprivation of rights. His proposal went nowhere. Instead, apparently to limit costs to the universities, Walter Byers had implemented the year-by-year scholarship rule that Joseph Agnew would challenge in court 37 years later. Moreover, the NCAA’s 1975 convention adopted a second recommendation “to discourage legal actions against the NCAA,” according to the minutes. The members voted to create Bylaw 19.7, Restitution, to intimidate college athletes in disputes with the NCAA. Johnson recognized this provision all too well, having won the temporary court judgment that the rule was illegal if not downright despotic. It made him nearly apoplectic to learn that the NCAA had deliberately drawn up the restitution rule as an obstacle to due process, contrary to the recommendation of its own lawyer. “They want to crush these kids,” he says.', '', 'The NCAA, of course, has never expressed such a desire, and its public comments on due process tend to be anodyne. At a congressional hearing in 2004, the infractions-committee vice chair, Josephine Potuto, repeatedly argued that although the NCAA is “not bound by any judicial due process standards,” its enforcement, infractions, and hearing procedures meet and “very likely exceed” those of other public institutions. Yet when pressed, Potuto declared that athletes would have no standing for due process even if the Supreme Court had not exempted the NCAA in the 1988 Tarkanian decision. “In order to reach due-process issues as a legal Constitutional principle, the individual challenging has to have a substantive property or liberty interest,” she testified. “The opportunity to play intercollegiate athletics does not rise to that level.”', '', 'To translate this from the legal jargon, Potuto used a circular argument to confine college athletes beneath any right to freedom or property in their own athletic effort. They have no stake to seek their rights, she claimed, because they have no rights at stake.', '', 'Potuto’s assertion might be judged preposterous, an heir of the Dred Scott dictum that slaves possessed no rights a white person was bound to respect. But she was merely being honest, articulating assumptions almost everyone shares without question. Whether motivated by hostility for students (as critics like Johnson allege), or by noble and paternalistic tough love (as the NCAA professes), the denial of fundamental due process for college athletes has stood unchallenged in public discourse. Like other NCAA rules, it emanates naturally from the premise that college athletes own no interest in sports beyond exercise, character-building, and good fun. Who represents these young men and women? No one asks.', '', 'The debates and commissions about reforming college sports nibble around the edges—trying to reduce corruption, to prevent the “contamination” of athletes by lucre, and to maintain at least a pretense of concern for academic integrity. Everything stands on the implicit presumption that preserving amateurism is necessary for the well-being of college athletes. But while amateurism—and the free labor it provides—may be necessary to the preservation of the NCAA, and perhaps to the profit margins of various interested corporations and educational institutions, what if it doesn’t benefit the athletes? What if it hurts them?', '', '“The Plantation Mentality”', '“Ninety percent of the NCAA revenue is produced by 1 percent of the athletes,” Sonny Vaccaro says. “Go to the skill positions”—the stars. “Ninety percent African Americans.” The NCAA made its money off those kids, and so did he. They were not all bad people, the NCAA officials, but they were blind, Vaccaro believes. “Their organization is a fraud.”', '', 'Vaccaro retired from Reebok in 2007 to make a clean break for a crusade. “The kids and their parents gave me a good life,” he says in his peppery staccato. “I want to give something back.” Call it redemption, he told me. Call it education or a good cause. “Here’s what I preach,” said Vaccaro. “This goes beyond race, to human rights. The least educated are the most exploited. I’m probably closer to the kids than anyone else, and I’m 71 years old.”', '', 'Vaccaro is officially an unpaid consultant to the plaintiffs in O’Bannon v. NCAA. He connected Ed O’Bannon with the attorneys who now represent him, and he talked to some of the additional co-plaintiffs who have joined the suit, among them Oscar Robertson, a basketball Hall of Famer who was incensed that the NCAA was still selling his image on playing cards 50 years after he left the University of Cincinnati.', '', 'Jon King, an antitrust lawyer at Hausfeld LLP in San Francisco, told me that Vaccaro “opened our eyes to massive revenue streams hidden in college sports.” King and his colleagues have drawn on Vaccaro’s vast knowledge of athletic-department finances, which include off-budget accounts for shoe contracts. Sonny Vaccaro and his wife, Pam, “had a mountain of documents,” he said. The outcome of the 1984 Regents decision validated an antitrust approach for O’Bannon, King argues, as well as for Joseph Agnew in his continuing case against the one-year scholarship rule. Lawyers for Sam Keller—a former quarterback for the University of Nebraska who is featured in video games—are pursuing a parallel “right of publicity” track based on the First Amendment. Still other lawyers could revive Rick Johnson’s case against NCAA bylaws on a larger scale, and King thinks claims for the rights of college players may be viable also under laws pertaining to contracts, employment, and civil rights.', '', 'Vaccaro had sought a law firm for O’Bannon with pockets deep enough to withstand an expensive war of attrition, fearing that NCAA officials would fight discovery to the end. So far, though, they have been forthcoming. “The numbers are off the wall,” Vaccaro says. “The public will see for the first time how all the money is distributed.”', '', 'Vaccaro has been traveling the after-dinner circuit, proselytizing against what he sees as the NCAA’s exploitation of young athletes. Late in 2008, someone who heard his stump speech at Howard University mentioned it to Michael Hausfeld, a prominent antitrust and human-rights lawyer, whose firm had won suits against Exxon for Native Alaskans and against Union Bank of Switzerland for Holocaust victims’ families. Someone tracked down Vaccaro on vacation in Athens, Greece, and he flew back directly to meet Hausfeld. The shoe salesman and the white-shoe lawyer made common cause.', '', 'Hausfeld LLP has offices in San Francisco, Philadelphia, and London. Its headquarters are on K Street in Washington, D.C., about three blocks from the White House. When I talked with Hausfeld there not long ago, he sat in a cavernous conference room, tidy in pinstripes, hands folded on a spotless table that reflected the skyline. He spoke softly, without pause, condensing the complex fugue of antitrust litigation into simple sentences. “Let’s start with the basic question,” he said, noting that the NCAA claims that student-athletes have no property rights in their own athletic accomplishments. Yet, in order to be eligible to play, college athletes have to waive their rights to proceeds from any sales based on their athletic performance.', '', '“What right is it that they’re waiving?,” Hausfeld asked. “You can’t waive something you don’t have. So they had a right that they gave up in consideration to the principle of amateurism, if there be such.” (At an April hearing in a U.S. District Court in California, Gregory Curtner, a representative for the NCAA, stunned O’Bannon’s lawyers by saying: “There is no document, there is no substance, that the NCAA ever takes from the student-athletes their rights of publicity or their rights of likeness. They are at all times owned by the student-athlete.” Jon King says this is “like telling someone they have the winning lottery ticket, but by the way, it can only be cashed in on Mars.” The court denied for a second time an NCAA motion to dismiss the O’Bannon complaint.)', '', 'The waiver clause is nestled among the paragraphs of the “Student-Athlete Statement” that NCAA rules require be collected yearly from every college athlete. In signing the statement, the athletes attest that they have amateur status, that their stated SAT scores are valid, that they are willing to disclose any educational documents requested, and so forth. Already, Hausfeld said, the defendants in the Ed O’Bannon case have said in court filings that college athletes thereby transferred their promotional rights forever. He paused. “That’s ludicrous,” he said. “Nobody assigns rights like that. Nobody can assert rights like that.” He said the pattern demonstrated clear abuse by the collective power of the schools and all their conferences under the NCAA umbrella—“a most effective cartel.”', '', 'The faux ideal of amateurism is “the elephant in the room,” Hausfeld said, sending for a book. “You can’t get to the bottom of our case without exposing the hypocrisy of amateurism, and Walter Byers says it eloquently.” An assistant brought in Byers’s memoir. It looked garish on the shiny table because dozens of pink Post-its protruded from the text. Hausfeld read to me from page 390:', '', 'The college player cannot sell his own feet (the coach does that) nor can he sell his own name (the college will do that). This is the plantation mentality resurrected and blessed by today’s campus executives.', 'He looked up. “That wasn’t me,” he said. “That was the NCAA’s architect.” He found a key recommendation on page 388:', '', 'Prosecutors and the courts, with the support of the public, should use antitrust laws to break up the collegiate cartel—not just in athletics but possibly in other aspects of collegiate life as well.', 'Could the book become evidence? Might the aged Byers testify? (He is now 89.) Was that part of the plaintiffs’ strategy for the O’Bannon trial? Hausfeld smiled faintly. “I’d rather the NCAA lawyers not fully understand the strategy,” he said.', '', 'He put the spiny book away and previewed what lies ahead. The court soon would qualify his clients as a class. Then the Sherman Antitrust Act would provide for thorough discovery to break down exactly what the NCAA receives on everything from video clips to jerseys, contract by contract. “And we want to know what they’re carrying on their books as the value of their archival footage,” he concluded. “They say it’s a lot of money. We agree. How much?”', '', 'The work will be hard, but Hausfeld said he will win in the courts, unless the NCAA folds first. “Why?” Hausfeld asked rhetorically. “We know our clients are foreclosed: neither the NCAA nor its members will permit them to participate in any of that licensing revenue. Under the law, it’s up to them [the defendants] to give a pro-competitive justification. They can’t. End of story.”', '', 'IN 2010 THE third Knight Commission, complementing a previous commission’s recommendation for published reports on academic progress, called for the finances of college sports to be made transparent and public—television contracts, conference budgets, shoe deals, coaches’ salaries, stadium bonds, everything. The recommendation was based on the worthy truism that sunlight is a proven disinfectant. But in practice, it has not been applied at all. Conferences, coaches, and other stakeholders resisted disclosure; college players still have no way of determining their value to the university.', '', '“Money surrounds college sports,” says Domonique Foxworth, who is a cornerback for the NFL’s Baltimore Ravens and an executive-committee member for the NFL Players Association, and played for the University of Maryland. “And every player knows those millions are floating around only because of the 18-to-22-year-olds.” Yes, he told me, even the second-string punter believes a miracle might lift him into the NFL, and why not? In all the many pages of the three voluminous Knight Commission reports, there is but one paragraph that addresses the real-life choices for college athletes. “Approximately 1 percent of NCAA men’s basketball players and 2 percent of NCAA football players are drafted by NBA or NFL teams,” stated the 2001 report, basing its figures on a review of the previous 10 years, “and just being drafted is no assurance of a successful professional career.” Warning that the odds against professional athletic success are “astronomically high,” the Knight Commission counsels college athletes to avoid a “rude surprise” and to stick to regular studies. This is sound advice as far as it goes, but it’s a bromide that pinches off discussion. Nothing in the typical college curriculum teaches a sweat-stained guard at Clemson or Purdue what his monetary value to the university is. Nothing prods students to think independently about amateurism—because the universities themselves have too much invested in its preservation. Stifling thought, the universities, in league with the NCAA, have failed their own primary mission by providing an empty, cynical education on college sports.', '', 'The most basic reform would treat the students as what they are—adults, with rights and reason of their own—and grant them a meaningful voice in NCAA deliberations. A restoration of full citizenship to “student-athletes” would facilitate open governance, making it possible to enforce pledges of transparency in both academic standards and athletic finances. Without that, the NCAA has no effective checks and balances, no way for the students to provide informed consent regarding the way they are governed. A thousand questions lie willfully silenced because the NCAA is naturally afraid of giving “student-athletes” a true voice. Would college players be content with the augmented scholarship or allowance now requested by the National College Players Association? If a player’s worth to the university is greater than the value of his scholarship (as it clearly is in some cases), should he be paid a salary? If so, would teammates in revenue sports want to be paid equally, or in salaries stratified according to talent or value on the field? What would the athletes want in Division III, where athletic budgets keep rising without scholarships or substantial sports revenue? Would athletes seek more or less variance in admissions standards? Should non-athletes also have a voice, especially where involuntary student fees support more and more of college sports? Might some schools choose to specialize, paying players only in elite leagues for football, or lacrosse? In athletic councils, how much would high-revenue athletes value a simple thank you from the tennis or field-hockey players for the newly specified subsidies to their facilities?', '', 'University administrators, already besieged from all sides, do not want to even think about such questions. Most cringe at the thought of bargaining with athletes as a general manager does in professional sports, with untold effects on the budgets for coaches and every other sports item. “I would not want to be part of it,” North Carolina Athletic Director Dick Baddour told me flatly. After 44 years at UNC, he could scarcely contemplate a world without amateur rules. “We would have to think long and hard,” Baddour added gravely, “about whether this university would continue those sports at all.”', '', 'I, too, once reflexively recoiled at the idea of paying college athletes and treating them like employees or professionals. It feels abhorrent—but for reasons having to do more with sentiment than with practicality or law. Not just fans and university presidents but judges have often found cursory, non-statutory excuses to leave amateur traditions intact. “Even in the increasingly commercial modern world,” said a federal-court judge in Gaines v. NCAA in 1990, “this Court believes there is still validity to the Athenian concept of a complete education derived from fostering the full growth of both mind and body.” The fact that “the NCAA has not distilled amateurism to its purest form,” said the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in 1988, “does not mean its attempts to maintain a mixture containing some amateur elements are unreasonable.”', '', 'But one way or another, the smokescreen of amateurism may soon be swept away. For one thing, a victory by the plaintiffs in O’Bannon’s case would radically transform college sports. Colleges would likely have to either stop profiting from students or start paying them. The NCAA could also be forced to pay tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars in damages. If O’Bannon and Vaccaro and company win, “it will turn college sports on its ear,” said Richard Lapchick, the president of the National Consortium for Academics and Sports, in a recent interview with The New York Times.', '', 'Though the O’Bannon case may take several years yet to reach resolution, developments on other fronts are chipping away at amateurism, and at the NCAA. This past summer, Sports Illustrated editorialized in favor of allowing college athletes to be paid by non-university sources without jeopardizing their eligibility. At a press conference last June, Steve Spurrier, the coach of the South Carolina Gamecocks football team (and the winner of the 1966 Heisman Trophy as a Florida Gator), proposed that coaches start paying players $300 a game out of their own pockets. The coaches at six other SEC schools (Alabama, Florida, Ole Miss, Mississippi State, LSU, and Tennessee) all endorsed Spurrier’s proposal. And Mark Emmert, the NCAA president, recently conceded that big changes must come. “The integrity of collegiate athletics is seriously challenged today by rapidly growing pressures coming from many directions,” Emmert said in July. “We have reached a point where incremental change is not sufficient to meet these challenges. I want us to act more aggressively and in a more comprehensive way than we have in the past. A few new tweaks of the rules won’t get the job done.”', '', 'Threats to NCAA dominion also percolate in Congress. Aggrieved legislators have sponsored numerous bills. Senator Orrin Hatch, citing mistreatment of his Utah Utes, has called witnesses to discuss possible antitrust remedies for the Bowl Championship Series. Congressional committees have already held hearings critical of the NCAA’s refusal to follow due process in disciplinary matters; other committees have explored a rise in football concussions. Last January, calls went up to investigate “informal” football workouts at the University of Iowa just after the season-ending bowl games—workouts so grueling that 41 of the 56 amateur student-athletes collapsed, and 13 were hospitalized with rhabdomyolysis, a life-threatening kidney condition often caused by excessive exercise.', '', 'The greatest threat to the viability of the NCAA may come from its member universities. Many experts believe that the churning instability within college football will drive the next major change. President Obama himself has endorsed the drumbeat cry for a national playoff in college football. This past spring, the Justice Department questioned the BCS about its adherence to antitrust standards. Jim Delany, the commissioner of the Big Ten, has estimated that a national playoff system could produce three or four times as much money as the existing bowl system does. If a significant band of football schools were to demonstrate that they could orchestrate a true national playoff, without the NCAA’s assistance, the association would be terrified—and with good reason. Because if the big sports colleges don’t need the NCAA to administer a national playoff in football, then they don’t need it to do so in basketball. In which case, they could cut out the middleman in March Madness and run the tournament themselves. Which would deprive the NCAA of close to $1 billion a year, more than 95 percent of its revenue. The organization would be reduced to a rule book without money—an organization aspiring to enforce its rules but without the financial authority to enforce anything.', '', 'Thus the playoff dreamed of and hankered for by millions of football fans haunts the NCAA. “There will be some kind of playoff in college football, and it will not be run by the NCAA,” says Todd Turner, a former athletic director in four conferences (Big East, ACC, SEC, and Pac-10). “If I’m at the NCAA, I have to worry that the playoff group can get basketball to break away, too.”', '', 'This danger helps explain why the NCAA steps gingerly in enforcements against powerful colleges. To alienate member colleges would be to jeopardize its own existence. Long gone are television bans and the “death penalty” sentences (commanding season-long shutdowns of offending teams) once meted out to Kentucky (1952), Southwestern Louisiana (1973), and Southern Methodist University (1987). Institutions receive mostly symbolic slaps nowadays. Real punishments fall heavily on players and on scapegoats like literacy tutors.', '', 'A deeper reason explains why, in its predicament, the NCAA has no recourse to any principle or law that can justify amateurism. There is no such thing. Scholars and sportswriters yearn for grand juries to ferret out every forbidden bauble that reaches a college athlete, but the NCAA’s ersatz courts can only masquerade as public authority. How could any statute impose amateur status on college athletes, or on anyone else? No legal definition of amateur exists, and any attempt to create one in enforceable law would expose its repulsive and unconstitutional nature—a bill of attainder, stripping from college athletes the rights of American citizenship.', '', 'FOR ALL OUR queasiness about what would happen if some athletes were to get paid, there is a successful precedent for the professionalization of an amateur sports system: the Olympics. For years, Walter Byers waged war with the NCAA’s older and more powerful nemesis, the Amateur Athletic Union, which since 1894 had overseen U.S. Olympic athletes. Run in high-handed fashion, the AAU had infamously banned Jesse Owens for life in 1936—weeks after his four heroic gold medals punctured the Nazi claim of Aryan supremacy—because instead of using his sudden fame to tour and make money for the AAU at track meets across Europe, he came home early. In the early 1960s, the fights between the NCAA and the AAU over who should manage Olympic athletes become so bitter that President Kennedy called in General Douglas MacArthur to try to mediate a truce before the Tokyo Olympic Games.', '', 'Ultimately, Byers prevailed and effectively neutered the AAU. In November 1978, President Jimmy Carter signed the bipartisan Amateur Sports Act. Amateurism in the Olympics soon dissolved—and the world did not end. Athletes, granted a 20 percent voting stake on every Olympic sport’s governing body, tipped balances in the United States and then inexorably around the world. First in marathon races, then in tennis tournaments, players soon were allowed to accept prize money and keep their Olympic eligibility. Athletes profited from sponsorships and endorsements. The International Olympic Committee expunged the word amateur from its charter in 1986. Olympic officials, who had once disdained the NCAA for offering scholarships in exchange for athletic performance, came to welcome millionaire athletes from every quarter, while the NCAA still refused to let the pro Olympian Michael Phelps swim for his college team at Michigan.', '', 'This sweeping shift left the Olympic reputation intact, and perhaps improved. Only hardened romantics mourned the amateur code. “Hey, come on,” said Anne Audain, a track-and-field star who once held the world record for the 5,000 meters. “It’s like losing your virginity. You’re a little misty for awhile, but then you realize, Wow, there’s a whole new world out there!”', '', 'Without logic or practicality or fairness to support amateurism, the NCAA’s final retreat is to sentiment. The Knight Commission endorsed its heartfelt cry that to pay college athletes would be “an unacceptable surrender to despair.” Many of the people I spoke with while reporting this article felt the same way. “I don’t want to pay college players,” said Wade Smith, a tough criminal lawyer and former star running back at North Carolina. “I just don’t want to do it. We’d lose something precious.”', '', '“Scholarship athletes are already paid,” declared the Knight Commission members, “in the most meaningful way poss-ible: with a free education.” This evasion by prominent educators severed my last reluctant, emotional tie with imposed amateurism. I found it worse than self-serving. It echoes masters who once claimed that heavenly salvation would outweigh earthly injustice to slaves. In the era when our college sports first arose, colonial powers were turning the whole world upside down to define their own interests as all-inclusive and benevolent. Just so, the NCAA calls it heinous exploitation to pay college athletes a fair portion of what they earn.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,"['When Miss Gostrey arrived, at the end of a week, she made him a sign; he went immediately to see her, and it wasn\'t till then that he could again close his grasp on the idea of a corrective. This idea however was luckily all before him again from the moment he crossed the threshold of the little entresol of the Quartier Marboeuf into which she had gathered, as she said, picking them up in a thousand flights and funny little passionate pounces, the makings of a final nest. He recognised in an instant that there really, there only, he should find the boon with the vision of which he had first mounted Chad\'s stairs. He might have been a little scared at the picture of how much more, in this place, he should know himself ""in"" hadn\'t his friend been on the spot to measure the amount to his appetite. Her compact and crowded little chambers, almost dusky, as they at first struck him, with accumulations, represented a supreme general adjustment to opportunities and conditions. Wherever he looked he saw an old ivory or an old brocade, and he scarce knew where to sit for fear of a misappliance. The life of the occupant struck him of a sudden as more charged with possession even than Chad\'s or than Miss Barrace\'s; wide as his glimpse had lately become of the empire of ""things,"" what was before him still enlarged it; the lust of the eyes and the pride of life had indeed thus their temple. It was the innermost nook of the shrine—as brown as a pirate\'s cave. In the brownness were glints of gold; patches of purple were in the gloom; objects all that caught, through the muslin, with their high rarity, the light of the low windows. Nothing was clear about them but that they were precious, and they brushed his ignorance with their contempt as a flower, in a liberty taken with him, might have been whisked under his nose. But after a full look at his hostess he knew none the less what most concerned him. The circle in which they stood together was warm with life, and every question between them would live there as nowhere else. A question came up as soon as they had spoken, for his answer, with a laugh, was quickly: ""Well, they\'ve got hold of me!"" Much of their talk on this first occasion was his development of that truth. He was extraordinarily glad to see her, expressing to her frankly what she most showed him, that one might live for years without a blessing unsuspected, but that to know it at last for no more than three days was to need it or miss it for ever. She was the blessing that had now become his need, and what could prove it better than that without her he had lost himself?', '', '""What do you mean?"" she asked with an absence of alarm that, correcting him as if he had mistaken the ""period"" of one of her pieces, gave him afresh a sense of her easy movement through the maze he had but begun to tread. ""What in the name of all the Pococks have you managed to do?""', '', '""Why exactly the wrong thing. I\'ve made a frantic friend of little Bilham.""', '', '""Ah that sort of thing was of the essence of your case and to have been allowed for from the first."" And it was only after this that, quite as a minor matter, she asked who in the world little Bilham might be. When she learned that he was a friend of Chad\'s and living for the time in Chad\'s rooms in Chad\'s absence, quite as if acting in Chad\'s spirit and serving Chad\'s cause, she showed, however, more interest. ""Should you mind my seeing him? Only once, you know,"" she added.', '', '""Oh the oftener the better: he\'s amusing—he\'s original.""', '', '""He doesn\'t shock you?"" Miss Gostrey threw out.', '', '""Never in the world! We escape that with a perfection—! I feel it to be largely, no doubt, because I don\'t half-understand him; but our modus vivendi isn\'t spoiled even by that. You must dine with me to meet him,"" Strether went on. ""Then you\'ll see.\'', '', '""Are you giving dinners?""', '', '""Yes—there I am. That\'s what I mean.""', '', 'All her kindness wondered. ""That you\'re spending too much money?""', '', '""Dear no—they seem to cost so little. But that I do it to THEM. I ought to hold off.""', '', 'She thought again—she laughed. ""The money you must be spending to think it cheap! But I must be out of it—to the naked eye.""', '', 'He looked for a moment as if she were really failing him. ""Then you won\'t meet them?"" It was almost as if she had developed an unexpected personal prudence.', 'She hesitated. ""Who are they—first?""', '', '""Why little Bilham to begin with."" He kept back for the moment Miss Barrace. ""And Chad—when he comes—you must absolutely see.""', '', '""When then does he come?""', '', '""When Bilham has had time to write him, and hear from him about me. Bilham, however,"" he pursued, ""will report favourably—favourably for Chad. That will make him not afraid to come. I want you the more therefore, you see, for my bluff.""', '', '""Oh you\'ll do yourself for your bluff."" She was perfectly easy. ""At the rate you\'ve gone I\'m quiet.""', '', '""Ah but I haven\'t,"" said Strether, ""made one protest.""', '', 'She turned it over. ""Haven\'t you been seeing what there\'s to protest about?""', '', 'He let her, with this, however ruefully, have the whole truth. ""I haven\'t yet found a single thing.""', '', '""Isn\'t there any one WITH him then?""', '', '""Of the sort I came out about?"" Strether took a moment. ""How do I know? And what do I care?""', '', '""Oh oh!""—and her laughter spread. He was struck in fact by the effect on her of his joke. He saw now how he meant it as a joke. SHE saw, however, still other things, though in an instant she had hidden them. ""You\'ve got at no facts at all?""', '', 'He tried to muster them. ""Well, he has a lovely home.""', '', '""Ah that, in Paris,"" she quickly returned, ""proves nothing. That is rather it DISproves nothing. They may very well, you see, the people your mission is concerned with, have done it FOR him.""', '""Exactly. And it was on the scene of their doings then that Waymarsh and I sat guzzling.""', '', '""Oh if you forbore to guzzle here on scenes of doings,"" she replied, ""you might easily die of starvation."" With which she smiled at him. ""You\'ve worse before you.""', '', '""Ah I\'ve EVERYTHING before me. But on our hypothesis, you know, they must be wonderful.""', '', '""They ARE!"" said Miss Gostrey. ""You\'re not therefore, you see,"" she added, ""wholly without facts. They\'ve BEEN, in effect, wonderful.""', '', 'To have got at something comparatively definite appeared at last a little to help—a wave by which moreover, the next moment, recollection was washed. ""My young man does admit furthermore that they\'re our friend\'s great interest.""', '', '""Is that the expression he uses?""', '', 'Strether more exactly recalled. ""No—not quite.""', '', '""Something more vivid? Less?""', '', 'He had bent, with neared glasses, over a group of articles on a small stand; and at this he came up. ""It was a mere allusion, but, on the lookout as I was, it struck me. \'Awful, you know, as Chad is\'—those were Bilham\'s words.""', '', '""\'Awful, you know\'—? Oh!""—and Miss Gostrey turned them over. She seemed, however, satisfied. ""Well, what more do you want?""', '', 'He glanced once more at a bibelot or two, and everything sent him back. ""But it is all the same as if they wished to let me have it between the eyes.""', '', 'She wondered. ""Quoi donc?""', '', '""Why what I speak of. The amenity. They can stun you with that as well as with anything else.""', '""Oh,"" she answered, ""you\'ll come round! I must see them each,"" she went on, ""for myself. I mean Mr. Bilham and Mr. Newsome—Mr. Bilham naturally first. Once only—once for each; that will do. But face to face—for half an hour. What\'s Mr. Chad,"" she immediately pursued, ""doing at Cannes? Decent men don\'t go to Cannes with the—well, with the kind of ladies you mean.""', '', '""Don\'t they?"" Strether asked with an interest in decent men that amused her.', '', '""No, elsewhere, but not to Cannes. Cannes is different. Cannes is better. Cannes is best. I mean it\'s all people you know—when you do know them. And if HE does, why that\'s different too. He must have gone alone. She can\'t be with him.""', '', '""I haven\'t,"" Strether confessed in his weakness, ""the least idea."" There seemed much in what she said, but he was able after a little to help her to a nearer impression. The meeting with little Bilham took place, by easy arrangement, in the great gallery of the Louvre; and when, standing with his fellow visitor before one of the splendid Titians—the overwhelming portrait of the young man with the strangely-shaped glove and the blue-grey eyes—he turned to see the third member of their party advance from the end of the waxed and gilded vista, he had a sense of having at last taken hold. He had agreed with Miss Gostrey—it dated even from Chester—for a morning at the Louvre, and he had embraced independently the same idea as thrown out by little Bilham, whom he had already accompanied to the museum of the Luxembourg. The fusion of these schemes presented no difficulty, and it was to strike him again that in little Bilham\'s company contrarieties in general dropped.', '', '""Oh he\'s all right—he\'s one of US!"" Miss Gostrey, after the first exchange, soon found a chance to murmur to her companion; and Strether, as they proceeded and paused and while a quick unanimity between the two appeared to have phrased itself in half a dozen remarks—Strether knew that he knew almost immediately what she meant, and took it as still another sign that he had got his job in hand. This was the more grateful to him that he could think of the intelligence now serving him as an acquisition positively new. He wouldn\'t have known even the day before what she meant—that is if she meant, what he assumed, that they were intense Americans together. He had just worked round—and with a sharper turn of the screw than any yet—to the conception of an American intense as little Bilham was intense. The young man was his first specimen; the specimen had profoundly perplexed him; at present however there was light. It was by little Bilham\'s amazing serenity that he had at first been affected, but he had inevitably, in his circumspection, felt it as the trail of the serpent, the corruption, as he might conveniently have said, of Europe; whereas the promptness with which it came up for Miss Gostrey but as a special little form of the oldest thing they knew justified it at once to his own vision as well. He wanted to be able to like his specimen with a clear good conscience, and this fully permitted it. What had muddled him was precisely the small artist-man\'s way—it was so complete—of being more American than anybody. But it now for the time put Strether vastly at his ease to have this view of a new way.', '', 'The amiable youth then looked out, as it had first struck Strether, at a world in respect to which he hadn\'t a prejudice. The one our friend most instantly missed was the usual one in favour of an occupation accepted. Little Bilham had an occupation, but it was only an occupation declined; and it was by his general exemption from alarm, anxiety or remorse on this score that the impression of his serenity was made. He had come out to Paris to paint—to fathom, that is, at large, that mystery; but study had been fatal to him so far as anything COULD be fatal, and his productive power faltered in proportion as his knowledge grew. Strether had gathered from him that at the moment of his finding him in Chad\'s rooms he hadn\'t saved from his shipwreck a scrap of anything but his beautiful intelligence and his confirmed habit of Paris. He referred to these things with an equal fond familiarity, and it was sufficiently clear that, as an outfit, they still served him. They were charming to Strether through the hour spent at the Louvre, where indeed they figured for him as an unseparated part of the charged iridescent air, the glamour of the name, the splendour of the space, the colour of the masters. Yet they were present too wherever the young man led, and the day after the visit to the Louvre they hung, in a different walk, about the steps of our party. He had invited his companions to cross the river with him, offering to show them his own poor place; and his own poor place, which was very poor, gave to his idiosyncrasies, for Strether—the small sublime indifference and independences that had struck the latter as fresh—an odd and engaging dignity. He lived at the end of an alley that went out of an old short cobbled street, a street that went in turn out of a new long smooth avenue—street and avenue and alley having, however, in common a sort of social shabbiness; and he introduced them to the rather cold and blank little studio which he had lent to a comrade for the term of his elegant absence. The comrade was another ingenuous compatriot, to whom he had wired that tea was to await them ""regardless,"" and this reckless repast, and the second ingenuous compatriot, and the faraway makeshift life, with its jokes and its gaps, its delicate daubs and its three or four chairs, its overflow of taste and conviction and its lack of nearly all else—these things wove round the occasion a spell to which our hero unreservedly surrendered.', '', 'He liked the ingenuous compatriots—for two or three others soon gathered; he liked the delicate daubs and the free discriminations—involving references indeed, involving enthusiasms and execrations that made him, as they said, sit up; he liked above all the legend of good-humoured poverty, of mutual accommodation fairly raised to the romantic, that he soon read into the scene. The ingenuous compatriots showed a candour, he thought, surpassing even the candour of Woollett; they were red-haired and long-legged, they were quaint and queer and dear and droll; they made the place resound with the vernacular, which he had never known so marked as when figuring for the chosen language, he must suppose, of contemporary art. They twanged with a vengeance the aesthetic lyre—they drew from it wonderful airs. This aspect of their life had an admirable innocence; and he looked on occasion at Maria Gostrey to see to what extent that element reached her. She gave him however for the hour, as she had given him the previous day, no further sign than to show how she dealt with boys; meeting them with the air of old Parisian practice that she had for every one, for everything, in turn. Wonderful about the delicate daubs, masterful about the way to make tea, trustful about the legs of chairs and familiarly reminiscent of those, in the other time, the named, the numbered or the caricatured, who had flourished or failed, disappeared or arrived, she had accepted with the best grace her second course of little Bilham, and had said to Strether, the previous afternoon on his leaving them, that, since her impression was to be renewed, she would reserve judgement till after the new evidence.', '', ""The new evidence was to come, as it proved, in a day or two. He soon had from Maria a message to the effect that an excellent box at the Francais had been lent her for the following night; it seeming on such occasions not the least of her merits that she was subject to such approaches. The sense of how she was always paying for something in advance was equalled on Strether's part only by the sense of how she was always being paid; all of which made for his consciousness, in the larger air, of a lively bustling traffic, the exchange of such values as were not for him to handle. She hated, he knew, at the French play, anything but a box—just as she hated at the English anything but a stall; and a box was what he was already in this phase girding himself to press upon her. But she had for that matter her community with little Bilham: she too always, on the great issues, showed as having known in time. It made her constantly beforehand with him and gave him mainly the chance to ask himself how on the day of their settlement their account would stand. He endeavoured even now to keep it a little straight by arranging that if he accepted her invitation she should dine with him first; but the upshot of this scruple was that at eight o'clock on the morrow he awaited her with Waymarsh under the pillared portico. She hadn't dined with him, and it was characteristic of their relation that she had made him embrace her refusal without in the least understanding it. She ever caused her rearrangements to affect him as her tenderest touches. It was on that principle for instance that, giving him the opportunity to be amiable again to little Bilham, she had suggested his offering the young man a seat in their box. Strether had dispatched for this purpose a small blue missive to the Boulevard Malesherbes, but up to the moment of their passing into the theatre he had received no response to his message. He held, however, even after they had been for some time conveniently seated, that their friend, who knew his way about, would come in at his own right moment. His temporary absence moreover seemed, as never yet, to make the right moment for Miss Gostrey. Strether had been waiting till tonight to get back from her in some mirrored form her impressions and conclusions. She had elected, as they said, to see little Bilham once; but now she had seen him twice and had nevertheless not said more than a word."", '', 'Waymarsh meanwhile sat opposite him with their hostess between; and Miss Gostrey spoke of herself as an instructor of youth introducing her little charges to a work that was one of the glories of literature. The glory was happily unobjectionable, and the little charges were candid; for herself she had travelled that road and she merely waited on their innocence. But she referred in due time to their absent friend, whom it was clear they should have to give up. ""He either won\'t have got your note,"" she said, ""or you won\'t have got his: he has had some kind of hindrance, and, of course, for that matter, you know, a man never writes about coming to a box."" She spoke as if, with her look, it might have been Waymarsh who had written to the youth, and the latter\'s face showed a mixture of austerity and anguish. She went on however as if to meet this. ""He\'s far and away, you know, the best of them.""', '', '""The best of whom, ma\'am?""', '', '""Why of all the long procession—the boys, the girls, or the old men and old women as they sometimes really are; the hope, as one may say, of our country. They\'ve all passed, year after year; but there has been no one in particular I\'ve ever wanted to stop. I feel—don\'t YOU?—that I want to stop little Bilham; he\'s so exactly right as he is."" She continued to talk to Waymarsh. ""He\'s too delightful. If he\'ll only not spoil it! But they always WILL; they always do; they always have.""', '', '""I don\'t think Waymarsh knows,"" Strether said after a moment, ""quite what it\'s open to Bilham to spoil.""', '', '""It can\'t be a good American,"" Waymarsh lucidly enough replied; ""for it didn\'t strike me the young man had developed much in THAT shape.""', '', '""Ah,"" Miss Gostrey sighed, ""the name of the good American is as easily given as taken away! What IS it, to begin with, to BE one, and what\'s the extraordinary hurry? Surely nothing that\'s so pressing was ever so little defined. It\'s such an order, really, that before we cook you the dish we must at least have your receipt. Besides the poor chicks have time! What I\'ve seen so often spoiled,"" she pursued, ""is the happy attitude itself, the state of faith and—what shall I call it?—the sense of beauty. You\'re right about him""—she now took in Strether; ""little Bilham has them to a charm, we must keep little Bilham along."" Then she was all again for Waymarsh. ""The others have all wanted so dreadfully to do something, and they\'ve gone and done it in too many cases indeed. It leaves them never the same afterwards; the charm\'s always somehow broken. Now HE, I think, you know, really won\'t. He won\'t do the least dreadful little thing. We shall continue to enjoy him just as he is. No—he\'s quite beautiful. He sees everything. He isn\'t a bit ashamed. He has every scrap of the courage of it that one could ask. Only think what he MIGHT do. One wants really—for fear of some accident—to keep him in view. At this very moment perhaps what mayn\'t he be up to? I\'ve had my disappointments—the poor things are never really safe; or only at least when you have them under your eye. One can never completely trust them. One\'s uneasy, and I think that\'s why I most miss him now.""', '', 'She had wound up with a laugh of enjoyment over her embroidery of her idea—an enjoyment that her face communicated to Strether, who almost wished none the less at this moment that she would let poor Waymarsh alone. HE knew more or less what she meant; but the fact wasn\'t a reason for her not pretending to Waymarsh that he didn\'t. It was craven of him perhaps, but he would, for the high amenity of the occasion, have liked Waymarsh not to be so sure of his wit. Her recognition of it gave him away and, before she had done with him or with that article, would give him worse. What was he, all the same, to do? He looked across the box at his friend; their eyes met; something queer and stiff, something that bore on the situation but that it was better not to touch, passed in silence between them. Well, the effect of it for Strether was an abrupt reaction, a final impatience of his own tendency to temporise. Where was that taking him anyway? It was one of the quiet instants that sometimes settle more matters than the outbreaks dear to the historic muse. The only qualification of the quietness was the synthetic ""Oh hang it!"" into which Strether\'s share of the silence soundlessly flowered. It represented, this mute ejaculation, a final impulse to burn his ships. These ships, to the historic muse, may seem of course mere cockles, but when he presently spoke to Miss Gostrey it was with the sense at least of applying the torch. ""Is it then a conspiracy?""', '', '""Between the two young men? Well, I don\'t pretend to be a seer or a prophetess,"" she presently replied; ""but if I\'m simply a woman of sense he\'s working for you to-night. I don\'t quite know how—but it\'s in my bones."" And she looked at him at last as if, little material as she yet gave him, he\'d really understand. ""For an opinion THAT\'S my opinion. He makes you out too well not to.""', '', '""Not to work for me to-night?"" Strether wondered. ""Then I hope he isn\'t doing anything very bad.""', '', '""They\'ve got you,"" she portentously answered.', '', '""Do you mean he IS—?""', '', '""They\'ve got you,"" she merely repeated. Though she disclaimed the prophetic vision she was at this instant the nearest approach he had ever met to the priestess of the oracle. The light was in her eyes. ""You must face it now.""', '', 'He faced it on the spot. ""They HAD arranged—?""', '', '""Every move in the game. And they\'ve been arranging ever since. He has had every day his little telegram from Cannes.""', '', 'It made Strether open his eyes. ""Do you KNOW that?""', '', '""I do better. I see it. This was, before I met him, what I wondered whether I WAS to see. But as soon as I met him I ceased to wonder, and our second meeting made me sure. I took him all in. He was acting—he is still—on his daily instructions.""', '', '""So that Chad has done the whole thing?""', '', '""Oh no—not the whole. WE\'VE done some of it. You and I and \'Europe.\'""', '', '""Europe—yes,"" Strether mused.', '', '""Dear old Paris,"" she seemed to explain. But there was more, and, with one of her turns, she risked it. ""And dear old Waymarsh. You,"" she declared, ""have been a good bit of it.""', '', 'He sat massive. ""A good bit of what, ma\'am?""', '', '""Why of the wonderful consciousness of our friend here. You\'ve helped too in your way to float him to where he is.""', '', '""And where the devil IS he?""', '', 'She passed it on with a laugh. ""Where the devil, Strether, are you?""', '', 'He spoke as if he had just been thinking it out. ""Well, quite already in Chad\'s hands, it would seem."" And he had had with this another thought. ""Will that be—just all through Bilham—the way he\'s going to work it? It would be, for him, you know, an idea. And Chad with an idea—!""', '', '""Well?"" she asked while the image held him.', '', '""Well, is Chad—what shall I say?—monstrous?""', '', '""Oh as much as you like! But the idea you speak of,"" she said, ""won\'t have been his best. He\'ll have a better. It won\'t be all through little Bilham that he\'ll work it.""', '', 'This already sounded almost like a hope destroyed. ""Through whom else then?""', '', '""That\'s what we shall see!"" But quite as she spoke she turned, and Strether turned; for the door of the box had opened, with the click of the ouvreuse, from the lobby, and a gentleman, a stranger to them, had come in with a quick step. The door closed behind him, and, though their faces showed him his mistake, his air, which was striking, was all good confidence. The curtain had just again arisen, and, in the hush of the general attention, Strether\'s challenge was tacit, as was also the greeting, with a quickly deprecating hand and smile, of the unannounced visitor. He discreetly signed that he would wait, would stand, and these things and his face, one look from which she had caught, had suddenly worked for Miss Gostrey. She fitted to them all an answer for Strether\'s last question. The solid stranger was simply the answer—as she now, turning to her friend, indicated. She brought it straight out for him—it presented the intruder. ""Why, through this gentleman!"" The gentleman indeed, at the same time, though sounding for Strether a very short name, did practically as much to explain. Strether gasped the name back—then only had he seen Miss Gostrey had said more than she knew. They were in presence of Chad himself.', '', ""Our friend was to go over it afterwards again and again—he was going over it much of the time that they were together, and they were together constantly for three or four days: the note had been so strongly struck during that first half-hour that everything happening since was comparatively a minor development. The fact was that his perception of the young man's identity—so absolutely checked for a minute—had been quite one of the sensations that count in life; he certainly had never known one that had acted, as he might have said, with more of a crowded rush. And the rush though both vague and multitudinous, had lasted a long time, protected, as it were, yet at the same time aggravated, by the circumstance of its coinciding with a stretch of decorous silence. They couldn't talk without disturbing the spectators in the part of the balcony just below them; and it, for that matter, came to Strether—being a thing of the sort that did come to him—that these were the accidents of a high civilisation; the imposed tribute to propriety, the frequent exposure to conditions, usually brilliant, in which relief has to await its time. Relief was never quite near at hand for kings, queens, comedians and other such people, and though you might be yourself not exactly one of those, you could yet, in leading the life of high pressure, guess a little how they sometimes felt. It was truly the life of high pressure that Strether had seemed to feel himself lead while he sat there, close to Chad, during the long tension of the act. He was in presence of a fact that occupied his whole mind, that occupied for the half-hour his senses themselves all together; but he couldn't without inconvenience show anything—which moreover might count really as luck. What he might have shown, had he shown at all, was exactly the kind of emotion—the emotion of bewilderment—that he had proposed to himself from the first, whatever should occur, to show least. The phenomenon that had suddenly sat down there with him was a phenomenon of change so complete that his imagination, which had worked so beforehand, felt itself, in the connexion, without margin or allowance. It had faced every contingency but that Chad should not BE Chad, and this was what it now had to face with a mere strained smile and an uncomfortable flush."", '', ""He asked himself if, by any chance, before he should have in some way to commit himself, he might feel his mind settled to the new vision, might habituate it, so to speak, to the remarkable truth. But oh it was too remarkable, the truth; for what could be more remarkable than this sharp rupture of an identity? You could deal with a man as himself—you couldn't deal with him as somebody else. It was a small source of peace moreover to be reduced to wondering how little he might know in such an event what a sum he was setting you. He couldn't absolutely not know, for you couldn't absolutely not let him. It was a CASE then simply, a strong case, as people nowadays called such things,' a case of transformation unsurpassed, and the hope was but in the general law that strong cases were liable to control from without. Perhaps he, Strether himself, was the only person after all aware of it. Even Miss Gostrey, with all her science, wouldn't be, would she?—and he had never seen any one less aware of anything than Waymarsh as he glowered at Chad. The social sightlessness of his old friend's survey marked for him afresh, and almost in an humiliating way, the inevitable limits of direct aid from this source. He was not certain, however, of not drawing a shade of compensation from the privilege, as yet untasted, of knowing more about something in particular than Miss Gostrey did. His situation too was a case, for that matter, and he was now so interested, quite so privately agog, about it, that he had already an eye to the fun it would be to open up to her afterwards. He derived during his half-hour no assistance from her, and just this fact of her not meeting his eyes played a little, it must be confessed, into his predicament."", '', 'He had introduced Chad, in the first minutes, under his breath, and there was never the primness in her of the person unacquainted; but she had none the less betrayed at first no vision but of the stage, where she occasionally found a pretext for an appreciative moment that she invited Waymarsh to share. The latter\'s faculty of participation had never had, all round, such an assault to meet; the pressure on him being the sharper for this chosen attitude in her, as Strether judged it, of isolating, for their natural intercourse, Chad and himself. This intercourse was meanwhile restricted to a frank friendly look from the young man, something markedly like a smile, but falling far short of a grin, and to the vivacity of Strether\'s private speculation as to whether HE carried himself like a fool. He didn\'t quite see how he could so feel as one without somehow showing as one. The worst of that question moreover was that he knew it as a symptom the sense of which annoyed him. ""If I\'m going to be odiously conscious of how I may strike the fellow,"" he reflected, ""it was so little what I came out for that I may as well stop before I begin."" This sage consideration too, distinctly, seemed to leave untouched the fact that he WAS going to be conscious. He was conscious of everything but of what would have served him.', '', ""He was to know afterwards, in the watches of the night, that nothing would have been more open to him than after a minute or two to propose to Chad to seek with him the refuge of the lobby. He hadn't only not proposed it, but had lacked even the presence of mind to see it as possible. He had stuck there like a schoolboy wishing not to miss a minute of the show; though for that portion of the show then presented he hadn't had an instant's real attention. He couldn't when the curtain fell have given the slightest account of what had happened. He had therefore, further, not at that moment acknowledged the amenity added by this acceptance of his awkwardness to Chad's general patience. Hadn't he none the less known at the very time—known it stupidly and without reaction—that the boy was accepting something? He was modestly benevolent, the boy—that was at least what he had been capable of the superiority of making out his chance to be; and one had one's self literally not had the gumption to get in ahead of him. If we should go into all that occupied our friend in the watches of the night we should have to mend our pen; but an instance or two may mark for us the vividness with which he could remember. He remembered the two absurdities that, if his presence of mind HAD failed, were the things that had had most to do with it. He had never in his life seen a young man come into a box at ten o'clock at night, and would, if challenged on the question in advance, have scarce been ready to pronounce as to different ways of doing so. But it was in spite of this definite to him that Chad had had a way that was wonderful: a fact carrying with it an implication that, as one might imagine it, he knew, he had learned, how."", '', ""Here already then were abounding results; he had on the spot and without the least trouble of intention taught Strether that even in so small a thing as that there were different ways. He had done in the same line still more than this; had by a mere shake or two of the head made his old friend observe that the change in him was perhaps more than anything else, for the eye, a matter of the marked streaks of grey, extraordinary at his age, in his thick black hair; as well as that this new feature was curiously becoming to him, did something for him, as characterisation, also even—of all things in the world—as refinement, that had been a good deal wanted. Strether felt, however, he would have had to confess, that it wouldn't have been easy just now, on this and other counts, in the presence of what had been supplied, to be quite clear as to what had been missed. A reflexion a candid critic might have made of old, for instance, was that it would have been happier for the son to look more like the mother; but this was a reflexion that at present would never occur. The ground had quite fallen away from it, yet no resemblance whatever to the mother had supervened. It would have been hard for a young man's face and air to disconnect themselves more completely than Chad's at this juncture from any discerned, from any imaginable aspect of a New England female parent. That of course was no more than had been on the cards; but it produced in Strether none the less one of those frequent phenomena of mental reference with which all judgement in him was actually beset."", '', 'Again and again as the days passed he had had a sense of the pertinence of communicating quickly with Woollett—communicating with a quickness with which telegraphy alone would rhyme; the fruit really of a fine fancy in him for keeping things straight, for the happy forestalment of error. No one could explain better when needful, nor put more conscience into an account or a report; which burden of conscience is perhaps exactly the reason why his heart always sank when the clouds of explanation gathered. His highest ingenuity was in keeping the sky of life clear of them. Whether or no he had a grand idea of the lucid, he held that nothing ever was in fact—for any one else—explained. One went through the vain motions, but it was mostly a waste of life. A personal relation was a relation only so long as people either perfectly understood or, better still, didn\'t care if they didn\'t. From the moment they cared if they didn\'t it was living by the sweat of one\'s brow; and the sweat of one\'s brow was just what one might buy one\'s self off from by keeping the ground free of the wild weed of delusion. It easily grew too fast, and the Atlantic cable now alone could race with it. That agency would each day have testified for him to something that was not what Woollett had argued. He was not at this moment absolutely sure that the effect of the morrow\'s—or rather of the night\'s—appreciation of the crisis wouldn\'t be to determine some brief missive. ""Have at last seen him, but oh dear!""—some temporary relief of that sort seemed to hover before him. It hovered somehow as preparing them all—yet preparing them for what? If he might do so more luminously and cheaply he would tick out in four words: ""Awfully old—grey hair."" To this particular item in Chad\'s appearance he constantly, during their mute half-hour, reverted; as if so very much more than he could have said had been involved in it. The most he could have said would have been: ""If he\'s going to make me feel young—!"" which indeed, however, carried with it quite enough. If Strether was to feel young, that is, it would be because Chad was to feel old; and an aged and hoary sinner had been no part of the scheme.', '', ""The question of Chadwick's true time of life was, doubtless, what came up quickest after the adjournment of the two, when the play was over, to a cafe in the Avenue de l'Opera. Miss Gostrey had in due course been perfect for such a step; she had known exactly what they wanted—to go straight somewhere and talk; and Strether had even felt she had known what he wished to say and that he was arranging immediately to begin. She hadn't pretended this, as she HAD pretended on the other hand, to have divined Waymarsh's wish to extend to her an independent protection homeward; but Strether nevertheless found how, after he had Chad opposite to him at a small table in the brilliant halls that his companion straightway selected, sharply and easily discriminated from others, it was quite, to his mind, as if she heard him speak; as if, sitting up, a mile away, in the little apartment he knew, she would listen hard enough to catch. He found too that he liked that idea, and he wished that, by the same token, Mrs. Newsome might have caught as well. For what had above all been determined in him as a necessity of the first order was not to lose another hour, nor a fraction of one; was to advance, to overwhelm, with a rush. This was how he would anticipate—by a night-attack, as might be—any forced maturity that a crammed consciousness of Paris was likely to take upon itself to assert on behalf of the boy. He knew to the full, on what he had just extracted from Miss Gostrey, Chad's marks of alertness; but they were a reason the more for not dawdling. If he was himself moreover to be treated as young he wouldn't at all events be so treated before he should have struck out at least once. His arms might be pinioned afterwards, but it would have been left on record that he was fifty. The importance of this he had indeed begun to feel before they left the theatre; it had become a wild unrest, urging him to seize his chance. He could scarcely wait for it as they went; he was on the verge of the indecency of bringing up the question in the street; he fairly caught himself going on—so he afterwards invidiously named it—as if there would be for him no second chance should the present be lost. Not till, on the purple divan before the perfunctory bock, he had brought out the words themselves, was he sure, for that matter, that the present would be saved.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
